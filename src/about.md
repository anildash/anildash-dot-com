Having created Internet technologies for two decades, I’m focused on the way technology can transform society, media, the arts, government and culture.

My work is focused on ensuring that tech serves those who are most vulnerable and that it enables the most people to express themselves. This means that, while my work is grounded in tech, it is deeply connected to policy, culture, art, urbanism, social justice and other domains that tech has historically overlooked. I also try to be fairly accessible, especially to people who don't have access to these systems, so you can reach me at [a@anildash.com](mailto:a@anildash.com).

## Full Bio

Anil Dash leads the team behind [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), the friendly developer community where coders have collaborated to create and share millions of web apps, serving as CEO of Glitch until its acquisition by [Fastly](https://fastly.com/). Honored by the Webby Awards with its lifetime achievement award in 2022, Dash is recognized as a leading advocate for more humane, inclusive and ethical technology through his work as an entrepreneur, activist and writer.

He serves as a board member for organizations like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org), the pioneering nonprofit organization defending digital privacy and expression, [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/), the leading nonprofit investigative newsroom pushing for tech accountability, and the [Lower East Side Girls Club](https://girlsclub.org/), which serves girls and families in need in New York City. Previously, Dash was an advisor to the Obama White House’s Office of Digital Strategy, served for a decade on the board of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), the world’s largest community for coders, and was on the board of the [Data & Society Research Institute](https://datasociety.org/), which researches the cutting edge of tech's impact on society. Today, he continues to advise respected startups and non-profits including [DonorsChoose](https://donorschoose.org/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [The Human Utility](https://www.detroitwaterproject.org) and [Project Include](https://projectinclude.org). In 2009, he led a MacArthur-backed research project that carried out pioneering research on social media's impact on policy making. And during his tenure as CEO of Glitch, the company became the first tech startup to voluntarily recognize its workers' union.

As a writer and artist, Dash was a contributing editor and monthly columnist for _Wired_, has written for publications including _The Atlantic_ and _Businessweek_, co-created one of the first implementations of the technology now known as NFTs, had his works exhibited in the New Museum of Contemporary Art, and collaborated with Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda on one of the most popular [Spotify playlists](https://artists.spotify.com/blog/how-lin-manuel-miranda-and-anil-dash-turned-a-bruno-mars-song-into-a) of 2018.

Described by _The New Yorker_ as a “blogging pioneer”, his personal website has been cited in sources ranging from _The New York Times_ to hundreds of academic papers. In 2013, Time named @anildash one of the best accounts on Twitter, and he is the only person ever retweeted by both Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Prince, a succinct summarization of Dash’s interests. Dash has also been a keynote speaker and guest in a broad range of media ranging from the Aspen Ideas Festival to Desus and Mero's late-night show. He's also guested on most of your favorite podcasts.
Dash is based in New York City, where he lives with his wife Alaina Browne and their son Malcolm. Like most people, he has never played a round of golf, drank a cup of coffee, filed a patent, or graduated from college.

### anildash.com

I’ve been writing and publishing this personal blog (formerly dashes.com) continuously since 1999. With millions of words published in its nearly two-decade history, this is one of the few personal blogs that’s been quoted in sources ranging from the New York Times to the BBC to TMZ as well as hundreds of academic citations. This site was a Webby honoree in 2010 in the Personal Blog category, and has always tried to cover my recurring obsessions of technology, pop culture, and society.
