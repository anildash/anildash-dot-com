You should absolutely keep some ketchup around the house. And soy sauce, and Sriracha, and a good BBQ sauce. And some honey. But if you *really* want to add flavor to all kinds of dishes (I don't mean fancy stuff, but like, if you want to punch up a sandwich or a salad or make some dinnertime staple seem more *cuisine*) then I have a suggestion of two key things you should keep around at all times: roasted garlic and pickled onions.

It's surprisingly easy to make these two things. (And technically, if you roast the garlic by submerging it in oil, you can technically call it a "confit" and sound very fancy and French.) Accordingly, I have made a brief YouTube video explaining how I do it, and it's a vertical video, to demonstrate that I'm fluent in the vernacular of the Kids These Days. Please enjoy, or delight in how I did this all completely wrong. Bon app√©tit!
