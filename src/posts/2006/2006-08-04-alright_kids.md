You want links? You got links.

- Seth Stevenson [defends the word “sucks”](http://www.slate.com/id/2146866/) in Slate. This seems relevant to me because my keynote at the O’Reilly Open Source Conference last week was callled [Trying Not To Suck](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9526) and because I used to get in trouble with my dad when I was a kid and said something sucked
- [On the entitlement of fandom](http://www.teevee.org/archive/weblog/2006/07/09/162749.html) addresses the fundamental issue of people who try to kill the things they love. This an especially pronounced trait amongst crowds or groups of fans.
- Just randomly, this old Salon story about [the acquisition and death of Webrings](http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/12/05/webring/print.html) by Yahoo came up in a conversation today. I always loved reading Katharine Mieszkowski’s stories back then.
- What’s wrong with Social Software? [Part one](http://www.eod.com/blog/archive/2006/06/whats_wrong_with_social_software_1.html), [part two](http://www.eod.com/blog/archive/2006/06/whats_wrong_with_social_software_2.html), and [part three](http://www.eod.com/blog/archive/2006/06/whats_wrong_with_social_software_3.html). Greg Knauss is so smart I’m surprised The Man hasn’t had him killed.
- I do a lot of public speaking, so I tend to be pretty critical of presentations. (“Steve Jobs is a fantastic presenter, but do people really find smugness that appealing?”) However, I’m comfortable in saying [this presentation](http://www.intel.com/vpro/webcast/index.htm) a few months ago by Intel CEO Paul Otellini is just plain grim. If he’s not a natural presenter, why not get someone who is? If he’s excited about it, why doesn’t it show? This stuff matters!
- We will unleash a swarm of 480 million tiny satellites to blanket the globe in a coppery ring of surveillance! Bwa ha ha ha! Except [it actually happened](http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=516). Project West Ford makes the looneys seem sane.
- [Beaver Cheese, Cheese Reviews](http://beavercheese.org/index.php). Reviewing all 43 cheese from Monty Python’s [Cheese Shop sketch](http://beavercheese.org/Articles.php?mat=adef&amp;pg=1), and a number of other cheese as well. I also admire [CheeseReviews.org](http://cheesereviews.org/): “Cheese Reviews is still in it’s vestigial stages. But it is envisioned as ultimately being a full featured cheese portal and community.” I love cheese, and I love the web.
