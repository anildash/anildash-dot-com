![Office 2.0 Conference](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/office20conf.gif)

As part of all-Office day, I should mention that I’ll be speaking at the [Office 2.0 Conference](http://www.office20con.com/) on October 11-12 here in San Francisco. If you know me, you’ll probably not be surprised that I’d like to talk about how Office 2.0 connects to, say, Office 2000.
