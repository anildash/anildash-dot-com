[John Dvorak examines incidental online communities](http://www.pcmag.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=185493,00.asp), as opposed to explicit social communities like Friendster. There’s some nice praise for [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/) in there, too. Having had the chance to [spend some time](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/03/im_a_cranky_gee) with John recently, I’m more amused by his shenanigans, especially in light of useful articles like this one. He’s still a world-class troll, but he seems to fully understand that intellectual dishonesty is a powerful tool, and should only be used in service of important and valuable causes.
