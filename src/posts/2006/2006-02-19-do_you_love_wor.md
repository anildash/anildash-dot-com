I sure do love words. And even better, my friends do too. So they make great websites and books about it. Mark made [Neologasm](http://neologasm.org/), which I am very partial to because it documents (among other things) the words we regularly make up around the office at Six Apart. I am very glad to spend my days in a workplace that enjoys wordplay. But that’s not enough!

So, I return to the classics, [Double-Tongued Word Wrester](http://www.doubletongued.org/), the excellent word blog by [Grant Barrett](http://www.grantbarrett.com/), noted lexicographer and author of the upcoming [Official Dictionary of Unofficial English](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071458042/2020-20). In addition to his linguistic expertise, Grant was my original influence in learning how to become an expert on a subject by loudly and repeatedliy asserting one’s own overwhelming authority on a topic until others can’t help but acknowledge one’s genius. Though this isn’t a rare tactic in the technology industry, particularly in the niche which I inhabit, it came as a revelation to me that this technique could be so effective. Witness it for yourself [in Grant’s history of Ask MetaFilter answers](http://ask.metafilter.com/search_comments.mefi?user_ID=264)!

But blogs have a lot more to give to the worlds of etymology: There’s the concept of the [snowclone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone), the trope of performing a selective search and replace on a familiar linguistic structure. Besides being a favorite method of titling blog posts, it’s one of the few new words whose [etymology is completely documented](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000350.html). Language Log is a great resource; Its history of covering the “many words for snow” myth that gave snowclones their name is [well](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002248.html)[documented](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000061.html).

Of course, blogs have a long history of being obsessed with words. The [blog that is responsible](http://www.peterme.com) for the word “blog”, as well as having most directly inspired me to start blogging, has had a [peculiar etymological fixation](http://www.peterme.com/poontang/) for some time. Bloggers are the new neologists, if not the new etymologists.
