![Admit One](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/ticket-purple.jpg)

- [Divebars. Jukeboxes. Allen Iverson. Beerball. Super Mario Kart. NetFlix. LiveFuckingJournal. The way my girl looks in that skirt.](http://inertiacrept.livejournal.com/43187.html) Everything great about America, and everything great about every place else, all in one post. I *love* great writing on the web.
- [Ticket Generator](http://www.says-it.com/concertticket/). From the genius who brought you the original [Church Sign Generator](http://www.churchsigngenerator.com/), you can grant yourself evidence of admission to anything.
- Wow, I was very flattered by [Frank Shaw’s comments](http://glasshouse.waggeneredstrom.com/blogs/frankshaw/archive/2006/08/01/688.aspx) — how did I miss [his blog](http://glasshouse.waggeneredstrom.com/blogs/frankshaw/default.aspx) before?
- [Whatever Happened to Ask Jeeves](http://www.officepirates.com/officepirates/photos/0,25046,1214811,00.html)? I wanted to see him wandering around Chili Peppers-style, wearing just the Pets.com sock puppet.
- Here’s an odd but fun little [audio recording](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1069.html) of a session I did at the MeshForums conference back in May. It was quite different than the usual presentations I do, and if I recall correctly, I’d been on a redeye flight all night right before the talk, so there’s more stammering and incoherence than usual. All that being said, I like how it turned out, and you might too.
