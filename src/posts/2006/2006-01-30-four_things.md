Even though [Jason](http://www.kottke.org/06/01/four-things) asked me to write four things, suddenly I’ve got [one thing](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009SQ2VY/2020-20) stuck in my head. And I’m amazed this meme jumped from LiveJournal to the public-facing blogosphere — do you realize how rare that is? Anyway, enough meta, on with the trivia.

Four jobs I’ve had:

# Network/IT consultant

# Web developer

# Billing manager at a water company

# Random VP at a blogging company

Four movies I can watch over and over:

# [Boomerang](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JL72/2020-20)

# Kid ‘n Play’s “Class Act” (it’s like the lost 4th House Party movie!)

# [Sign O The Times](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006ZHRPK/2020-20)

# [Hero](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00030590I/2020-20)

Four places I’ve lived:

# College Park, MD

# Battlestar Galactica

# My Name Is Earl

# Deadwood

# The Honeymooners

# St. Elsewhere

Four places I’ve vacationed

Four of my favorite dishes:

# Soup dumplings

# Green tea mochi

# Grimaldi’s Pizza

# Shake Shack burgers

Four sites I visit daily:

Four places I would rather be right now:
