A little over a year ago, I [wore a funny t-shirt](/2005/06/02/defining_ones_i/) while posing for a photo that was published in [an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/fashion/thursdaystyles/02GOOGLE.html) in the New York Times. The [shirt](http://www.threadless.com/product/235/Goatse)‘s a reference to a popular (and rather offensive) internet meme, and the reaction was immediate and passionate:

- “I can’t believe you slipped one over The Man.” – [Grant Barrett](http://www.grantbarrett.com/), author *The Official Dictionary of Unofficial English*
- “Rather than the scary fragmentation of our society into a nation of disconnected people doing their own thing, I think we’re reforming into thousands of cultural tribes, connected less by geographic proximity and workplace chatter than by shared interests.” – [Chris Anderson](http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/06/tribal_culture.html), Editor-in-Chief of *Wired* and author of *The Long Tail*.
- “@$!%!” – [Mena Trott](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/), President and Co-Founder of Six Apart.

I’m 30 years old, and this is now the single thing I’m best-known for in the world. Now, I’m not worried about being a one-hit wonder, but I do see this as a perversely entertaining example of getting what I deserve. I’ve always said my sense of humor thrives on the absurd, and it doesn’t get any more absurd than having this stunt as one of the first things listed on [my wikipedia profile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Dash). At this rate, my epitaph is likely to be something like “He told great fart jokes.”

I’m reminded of this absurdity because I’d been reading *The Long Tail*. It was inevitable that I’d like the book — I’m (briefly) in it. Page 182 has a nice nod to my Goatse t-shirt escapades, providing support for my hope that the in-joke worked on multiple levels. (Note to aspiring media hackers: You can’t go wrong with a [nominally subversive t-shirt](http://i.rollingstone.com/assets/rs/110/76/images/23060_lg.jpg) if you’re looking to gain a small degree of notoriety amongst your peers.)

As of today, 13 months later, there’s approximately [twelve thousand mentions](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=anil+goatse) of the gag. To all those people, and to those whom I’ve had approach me at various events and conferences, asking me about the picture, I have one request. Can we *please* make sure to say I’m “the goatse *t-shirt* guy” and not “the goatse guy”? There’s a *big* difference.
