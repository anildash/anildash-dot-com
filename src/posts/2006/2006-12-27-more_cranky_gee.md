I’m on [Cranky Geeks again](http://www.crankygeeks.com/2006/12/cranky_geeks_episode_42_best_t.html) tomorrow.

Usually I cringe a little seeing myself on these things, but I think this time around we all acquitted ourselves rather well. There’s some talk about the best and worst tech stuff of 2006, and some fun skepticism about the Web 2.0 bubble. Plus John Dvorak, and who doesn’t love John Dvorak?
