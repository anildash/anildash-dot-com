If you’re looking for information on the [distributed denial of service attacks against Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2006/05/typepad_update_1.html), we’ve got some posts up, along with the [LiveJournal](http://status.livejournal.org/) and [TypePad](http://status.sixapart.com/) status sites being updated. I’m travelling a bit so I can’t update as much as I’d like, but we’ll have more info soon.

Dear attackers: Let the bloggers blog! Set my people free!
