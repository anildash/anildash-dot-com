Whoops, I should have mentioned this in time for you to see it live, but I was on [Cranky Geeks](http://crankygeeks.com/blogs/crankygeeks/archive/2006/08/02/852.aspx) with John Dvorak today. It’s a fun little web video show (vlog? vlogcast? vlogcastumentary?) where me and John and Sebastian Rupley (PC Mag editor) and Mike Liebhold (from the Institute from the Future) were talking about a bunch of random geek topics.

Seems like the live streaming was a bit choppy, so maybe it’s better to wait for the download anyway. Downloads of the video will be available tomorrow, and you can [subscribe to the videocast in iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=137090103&amp;s=143441) today. I promise it’s the best dorky video show you’ll watch that mentions Dvorak, dildos, and deep-fried dogs.
