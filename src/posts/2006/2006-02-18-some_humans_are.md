I’d been following Judith’s story of her lost camera with great interest until the [latest update](http://lostcamera.blogspot.com/2006/02/camera-unlost-but-not-quite-found.html) shocked me:

> “Well,” she said, “we have a bit of a situation. You see, my nine year old son found your camera, and we wanted to show him to do the right thing, so we called, but now he’s been using it for a week and he really loves it and we can’t bear to take it from him.”

Judith’s not the mob justice type of person, but if ever there were a good reason for a bunch of nosy curious bloggers to track someone down and make them do the right thing, this would be it for me.

I feel bad for a kid whose parents are that lost and misguided.
