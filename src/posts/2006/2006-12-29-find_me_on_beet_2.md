Andy Plesser of Beet.TV stopped by our offices at Six Apart a few weeks ago, and I had the chance to talk to him for a few minutes. Andy recorded the conversation on video, and now he’s just put up “[The Simple Secrets of Effective Videoblogging](http://www.beet.tv/2006/12/anil_dash_of_si.html)“.

Though I’m pretty good with text blogging, I’m by no means an expert at video blogging, so this was really just a chance for me to talk about what I’ve observed from video blogs so far that seems to work well. The clip is only about two minutes long, and two more parts of the interview should be following shortly.
