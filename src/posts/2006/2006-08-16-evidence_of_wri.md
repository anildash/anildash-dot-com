There’s been lots of discussion over Microsoft’s pretty decent desktop blogging client, Windows Live Writer. A [Seattle Post-Intelligencer story](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/281230_msftblog15.html) that I was quoted in apparently got [reprinted all over the place](http://news.google.com/news?q=anil+dash+microsoft+writer&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;filter=0), and I think the basic point was that I’m glad that mostly everybody in the blogging biz uses nice open APIs.

More interesting to me, though, was [the evidence of people trying the program out](http://blogs.icerocket.com/search?q=Temporary+Post+Used+For+Style+Detection). Just search for “Temporary Post Used For Style Detection” and join the fun.
