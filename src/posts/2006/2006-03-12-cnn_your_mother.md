Sometimes I see things and assume that either someone has the same sick sense of humor that I do, or else people have completely lost their sense of the absurd. From the sidebar on [this CNN news story](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/03/11/mob.ports.ap/index.html) today comes the following poll:
### Who would you rather have overseeing operations at U.S. ports?

- Arab-based ports company 
- U.S.-based mafia 

Whoa, seriously? Somebody went to j-school for *that*? I am certain that your mother must be proud you’re the guy who put that on CNN.com. ($10 via PayPal to the first person who can get me a definitive answer about who’s responsible for this lunacy.)  
 And two thirds of people who voted are in favor of *known criminals* running our ports? (Technically, it’s only 64% of the 55880 votes cast so far, but that’s still amazing.) Jon Stewart is clearly being overpaid, because some anonymous web wizard at CNN is a *lot* funnier than anything Comedy Central has conjured up.  
 Check out [the results](http://www.cnn.com/POLLSERVER/results/23733.exclude.html) for yourself, or just cast your own vote to see what everyone else thinks.
