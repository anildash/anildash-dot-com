I usually don’t do overt plugs for work stuff on my personal blog, but I’m pretty excited about a small event we’re doing here in San Francisco. It’s the first in our series of [Business Blogging Seminars](http://www.sixapart.com/business/seminar-contact), presented as part of our efforts at Six Apart to really get behind [business blogging](http://www.sixapart.com/business/). Judging by the response I’ve got to talking to people about business blogs at the [recent](http://blogbusinesssummit.com/2006/03/anil_dash_and_t.htm)[events](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/03/in_the_mix.html), there’s a lot of interest in how to actually make the damn things *work*.

If you’re one of those folks who loves blogging and needs to figure out how to get your boss to buy in to the idea, [sign up](http://www.sixapart.com/business/seminar-contact).
