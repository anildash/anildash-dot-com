There’s been an interesting wave of news since my [anti-Wikipedia](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/31/antipedia)[roundup](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/31/antiwikipedia_l) recently, most notably Jimmy Wales’ [comments about the evolution of the community](http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/07/HNwikifuture_1.html). This is an IDG article on his statements, but it seems to be sourced from the AP story that appeared everywhere, including [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71535-0.html), pegged to the beginning of the Wikimania conference.
