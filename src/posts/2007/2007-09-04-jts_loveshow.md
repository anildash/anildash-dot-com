[![Justin Timberlake - FutureSex/LoveSounds](https://cdn.glitch.global/d45aff89-36ba-46db-8c7c-3da7c8a93931/futuresex.jpg?v=1675742625299)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000H305U0/2020-20)

We just finished watching [HBO’s broadcast of Justin Timberlake’s FutureSex tour](https://web.archive.org/web/20070902053729/http://www.hbo.com/events/justintimberlake/), which I (unsurprisingly) quite enjoyed. It seems like he’s done a good bit since his last tour to incorporate his strong live band and his rapidly improving chops on guitar and keyboards to integrate real musicianship into the show.

Those were the primary things I wanted to see more of four years ago, when I wrote about [his live show at the Roseland](/2003/09/justin_timberla) here in NYC. If you liked that post, you might also enjoy [“SexyBack”: Pop for indie rock MP3 blogs](/2006/07/justin-timberla).
