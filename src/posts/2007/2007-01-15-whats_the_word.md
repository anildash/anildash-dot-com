I found Frank Hilario’s rant entitled [Microsoft’s Mr Bill Gates And The Boy Who Cried Worp](http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=19073) to be largely incoherent, but from what I could deduce, he thinks my [assessment of Microsoft Office 2007](/2006/06/19/office_2007_is_) is off-base. Actually, he says:

> If you can’t beat them, don’t join them; instead, change the rules of the game. That’s what Worperer Microsoft did with Word 2007, Paul Thurrott (2006, cited) says. Yes. Anil Dash (2006, cited) says: ‘By radically changing the user interface in Office 2007, Microsoft made the riskiest bet in the history of commercial software. And I think they’re going to win the bet.’ Wanna bet?
> 
> So, here’s another idea, also from me: Go get a fresh tablet of stone and etch on it the idea of an entirely new word processor. Worperers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your worps!

Once you’ve lost your worps, you may enjoy [Rafe’s musings](http://rc3.org/2007/01/defining_your_m.php) on music collections, inspired in part by my [loss of my iTunes library](/2007/01/10/my_library_is_d). There are also a lot of really great comments on that thread, thanks to everyone who’s contributed.
