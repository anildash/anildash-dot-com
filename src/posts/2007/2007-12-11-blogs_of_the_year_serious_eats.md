**Today’s Blog of the Year Pick:**[Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com).

I love food, but I could never quite put my finger on what was wrong with the food blogs I’d tried to read until Serious Eats came along. As it turns out, I like cooking and I like learning about restaurants, but what it turns out I really *love* is simple: *Eating*.

Ed Levine’s assembled a team of extraordinarily talented food lovers (which, it should be noted, includes my wife), and they stay true to the site’s mantra of being passionate, discerning and inclusive. I feel like an old-timer in the way I look at blogs, because I still think of them as being fairly static affairs consisting largely of text. But Serious Eats features a [formidable video section](http://www.seriouseats.com/videos/) with original programming from Mario Batali, a [burgeoning recipe section](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/) and a [guide to eating out](http://www.seriouseats.com/eating_out/) that all complement the site’s own editorial blog posts. Wrap it all up in an incredibly well-designed, beautiful aesthetic that combines elegant details with frequent fun illustrations, and it’s an unquestionable winner.
**Pick of the Posts:**

- [Talk](http://www.seriouseats.com/talk/): This Q&A section is the heart of the Eats, for me. I’m mostly a lurker here, but I never cease to be amazed how often I’m saying, “I wish I’d asked that!”
- [Serious Eats Thanksgiving](http://www.seriouseats.com/thanksgiving/): Sure, the holiday’s passed, but if you want a look at how the site does well-trod topics in a unique way, this is it.
- [Extended Meatloaf Coverage](http://www.seriouseats.com/tags/meatloaf): From recipes to National Meatloaf Appreciation Day to photos of dozens of loaves, I discovered this staple of mashed meat this year thanks to the site.
**If you like this, try:** Elise Bauer’s [Simply Recipes](http://elise.com/recipes/) gets me every time — not because of the recipes, though they’re great. It’s the photography, which is simply beautiful.
