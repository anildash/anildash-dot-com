Do you want links? Because I’ll give you some damn links, I’m not afraid of you! I’m not afraid of NOBODY!

- Reyhan Harmanci on the [third wave of academic study of hip hop](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/03/05/DDG3MOE3041.DTL&amp;type=printable):

> Dominant, a UC Berkeley alumnus who actually attended the much-publicized class on Shakur in the late ’90s, says that he finds value in hip-hop studies, provided they take the long view. “With hip-hop and all black music, you can’t talk about the art separate from a lot of other things,” he says. “You can’t talk about hip-hop as an art form without talking about the people, the economics, how and why it was made. You have to be pretty thorough.”
> 
> Finding ways to teach and study hip-hop from within a university setting is not easy. “I worry that scholars like us get so obsessed with trying to justify hip-hop that we end up running in circles,” says Berkeley grad student Felicia Viator, a DJ who’s finishing up a doctorate in history.

- Businessweek’s Catherine Holahan [looks at the unfiltered conversations](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070306_588600.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily) that have sprung up in light of community changes after USA Today’s recent web redesign. I don’t know that I’d make a change in the cultural assumptions of a site at the same time as aesthetic/UI changes, because then you don’t know which one caused everybody to lose their minds.
- Speaking of which, I [started a shitstorm](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White) by suggesting that Ask MetaFilter should have a white background. My personal experience is that the site *is* white, since I’ve customized my account, but I didn’t, uh… make a very good case that it should be the default because I was a bit uncharacteristically combative. On the other hand, I learned I’m [a twit](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392099), a [shrill, self-promoting, a-list retard](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392223) who’s [not good at building community](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392220), [more than out of touch](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392198), prone to [issuing stridently absurd protestations](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392120), deserved of [getting pissed on by an elephant](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392095), who is only [being taken seriously … because [I’m] friends with Matt Haughey](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392031) and I’m encouraging [selling out](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White#392004). One of my toughest critics in the thread had actually proposed a winning redesign in a contest on the site, an entry that featured a white background and *was voted the winner* by the entire community. I don’t know why people think the blogosphere is an unfriendly place, when an honest suggestion to *change the background color* on one subsite of a popular community blog that [I’m a huge fan of](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/12/11/how_matt_haughe) can inspire those kinds of delightful, well-considered reactions. At least there was only one vague threat of violence.
- I was surprised to find [a list of Fall Out Boy’s favorite albums](http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20012352,00.html) to be somewhat interesting.
- [Ask the Wizard](http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/), written by Feedburner CEO Dick Costolo is, flat out, the best new blog of 2007. The thing I love about great writing is it makes the pervasive truths seem self-evident and even obvious. Plus it’s *actually* funny, not another tech exec wearing a goofy tie and claiming to be full of ha-ha.
- There was a lot of link love for the [list of NYC’s ugliest buildings](http://gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/ugliest-buildings-in-new-york-according-to-the-experts-238431.php) on Gridskipper, but the overlooked gem was the [pan of the Astor Place Monster](http://www.newyorker.com/critics/skyline/articles/050502crsk_skyline) from the New Yorker a few years back. Man, that thing still startles me (in a bad way!) every time I walk by.
- Dear Drew, have you considered changing the font on Fark’s homepage?
- This is the old [Top 5% of all Web Sites](http://sunsite.nus.edu.sg/pub/humour/5perclgt.gif) graphic that used to be used by Point. Which was actually Point Communications, which was actually at pointcom.com, until it sold to Lycos during a period of the web’s history 10 years ago that is apparently so old nobody caught the reference. Winning the meaningless award used to be [accompanied by an email](http://www.spotsylvania.k12.va.us/NSPT/nsptop5.htm) alerting you to the good news. I suspect Todd Whitney is not still toiling away at Lycos.
- [Indie rock is a cult of failure](http://slumbering.lungfish.com/?p=327). Could be worse, it could be [emo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri6ySOHoDfk).
- I spoke at the Northern Voice conference in Vancouver a little over a week ago, and there’s [video of my presentation](http://northernvoice.podcastspot.com/episodes/FF8767) up on the web, albeit with suboptimal sound. But it kind of gives you a feel for what we were all talking about, if you have the patience to sit through it. (My part starts about five minutes in.)
- I wanted to be uniformly supportive of [the Times story about the struggle of Asian pop acts](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/fashion/04asians.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin), but I’d felt kind of conflicted and couldn’t articulate why. Fortunately, [Sree Sreenivasan articulated it concisely](http://www.sajaforum.org/2007/03/media_watch_nyt.html): We’re Asians too, dammit.
- If you’ve somehow missed them, a few articles on the tech generation gap. [Emily Nussbaum’s excellent, definitive look](http://nymag.com/news/features/27341/index.html) at the distinctions between the technological expectations of those born before and after 1977 in regard to privacy seems like the coming-out party for the topics [danah](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) has been talking about forever. A simpler, but still compelling, [Tim Bajarin piece](http://www.pcmag.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=202251,00.asp) in PC Magazine complements it nicely. And the [WaPo sez](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/03/AR2007030300978.html) colleges have lost track of students because the schools are still trying to use phones and email to talk to kids who only use Facebook and IM. Whoops.
- Here, take this: [A capella Beastie Boys vocals](http://www.beastieboys.com/remixers.php) from some of their best tracks.
- Remind me to run all of this through [the Cliché Detector](http://danieltsadok.net/cliche_detector.php) later.
- Someday, me and [Kal Penn](http://nymag.com/movies/profiles/28866/index.html) in a steel cage match for Most Famous Indian in America. Someday.
