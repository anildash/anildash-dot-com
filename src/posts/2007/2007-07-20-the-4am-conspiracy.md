[Rives](http://www.shopliftwindchimes.com/) is a charming spoken-word artist whom I had the chance to befriend before I spoke at [Taste3](http://taste3.com/2007/highlights.php) this year. Heâ€™s got a true gift for speaking to an audience, as you can tell in this clip from TED Talks about the conspiracy that takes place at 4AM. He performed this piece at Taste3 as well, which is where i first saw it.

Still no word on whether [Gwen Stefani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_in_the_Morning) has weighed in on the conspiracy.
