A few years ago, I wrote a post called [Portalization](/2004/05/17/portalization) which showed a Yahoo homepage screenshot with certain services grayed-out, as an indicator of which corresponding tools Google offered. It was a look at how Google’s feature set had expanded with the (then-new) Gmail, and inspired some comments speculating about My Google, which later launched as Google Personalized Homepage.

A couple of years later, Google offers many more of the services that used to be Yahoo’s domain — and Steve Bryant’s independently [come up with a mockup](http://googlewatch.eweek.com/content/today_in_stupid/mockup_what_if_google_made_a_yahoolike_start_page_1.html) of a Yahoo-style Google homepage. I can’t decide if it’s brilliant or terrifying, but I do wonder what adoption of Google’s non-search services would look like if this design were adopted.
