Over at HipHopMusic.com, which Jay Smooth has relaunched as a group blog, Brandon Soderberg offers [When They Reminisce Over Mixtapes](http://www.hiphopmusic.com/2007/07/when_they_reminisce_over_mixta.html). The same industry that makes millions from “Now That’s What I Call Cherry-Picking Hit Singles! Vol 42” tries to throw black artists in jail for making mixtapes that were commissioned by the labels themselves. And an artform dies in the crossfire.
