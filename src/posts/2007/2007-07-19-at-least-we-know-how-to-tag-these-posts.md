Reflecting on [toread is tobehuman](/2007/07/16/toread-is-tobehuman/):

- [Dave Coustan says](http://blogs.earthlink.net/2007/07/on_the_product_blogs.php), “I use [this is good] to mark things I find particularly excellent.” Me too. Heh.
- And [Ed Kohler asks](http://www.technologyevangelist.com/2007/07/toread_howto_and_del.html) about toread and howto, “Both tags do something other than describing the information directly, the way a tag for “blogging” or “php” may do. Instead, the tags refer to how people relate to the information. Do you know of any other examples of this?”
