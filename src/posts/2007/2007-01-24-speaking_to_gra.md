This morning, I had the opportunity to speak to the [Northern California Grantmakers’ meeting](http://ncg.org/), which was a fantastic chance for me to speak to a group of people who really help make society better.

Among the many warm, intelligent people I met this morning was [Lucy Berhholz](http://philanthropy.blogspot.com/). She very kindly blogged a lot of my presentation, but also made me really happy by pointing out a horrible cultural assumption I made while talking:

> on timeframes and multi-tasking. His example: being in a meeting getting interrupted by an email newsletter that breaks his train of thought about the email he was looking for. Most of the audience is of a generation that uses email to be less intrusive than the phone.

[Lucy’s post](http://philanthropy.blogspot.com/2007/01/nocal-grantmakers.html) is great, it even includes audio of the presentation. I pride myself on trying to not talk about things that are too insular or too geeky for an audience, but here I revealed myself for the geek I am. These reminders are really helpful if you’re trying to not simply talk to people who are just like yourself.
