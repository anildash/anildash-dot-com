The New York Times is [removing the payment barrier](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/media/18times.html?ex=1347768000&amp;en=88011ab45717e39d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink) from its TimesSelect content. Hooray!

I [pundified* incorrectly](/2005/05/spare-some-chan) about this two years ago when they launched TimesSelect — go look and marvel at my foolishness! **Update:**[Andre](http://notes.torrez.org/) points out that this is just a Hail Mary play to [win a bet](http://www.longbets.org/2). The Long Bet is broken anyway, because it presumes a blogs-vs-Times model, which of course isn’t accurate.

 * “Pundify” is to pontificate without the burden of facts and in full embrace of intellectual dishonesty.
