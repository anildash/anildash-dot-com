Rip, Mix, and Burn? It’s not new. [Contrafact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrafacts) is what they called sampling before there was sampling. You take the chords from a song that the whole band knows, and play your new song on top of it. Familiar but new, *and* you don’t have to pay royalties. While the haters say “that’s not music!”, you’re busy making the theme song to *The Flintstones*, or maybe [Fear of a Black Planet](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000024IE/2020-20).

The most legendary contrafact-ual chords? The [Rhythm changes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_changes), based on Gershwin’s “I Got Rhythm”. You could list [more than a hundred](http://abel.hive.no/oj/musikk/trompet/tpin/rhytm-changes.html) songs based off the jazz standard ten years ago; There are undoubtedly dozens more today. Interestingly, none of the contrafacts of this classic are better-known than the original, but the fact that so many brilliant derivations have been created has helped burnish Gershwin’s reputation as a genius.

It’s almost as if letting people use the base of your work as the seed for their own creativity only acts to help both parties.
