The Donors Choose Bloggers Challenge that I [wrote about a few weeks ago](/2007/10/choosing-to-help-kids) is almost over, and that means you only have a few days to help support the [Notes for Class Challenge](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=17149), an effort to help fund music education programs that have been proposed by the teachers who will be overseeing them.

As I mentioned earlier, I’ll be **personally matching 10% of all donations** — the incredibly generous readers of my site have already contributed over *two thousand dollars*, supporting music education programs for nearly 1700 kids. It’s pretty astounding, but we’re not that far away from nearly *doubling* the number of students we can help. Take a look at efforts like the [Music Bingo](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=86910&amp;challengeid=17149&amp;zone=0) proposal in North Carolina: If just a few more of you donate, my matching donation for the Challenge will help us sponsor a project that helps 1000 more students.

I’ve been blogging over 8 years now, and in all that time, I’ve never personally endorsed a campaign like this or committed to matching donations in this way. So I hope any of you who’ve found the writing I’ve done on my blog over the years to be useful or valuable will take a few minutes to make a donation. For reference, the over 6,700 posts on this blog (and my old Daily Links blog), along with the comments that have responded to them, add up to over 1.2 million words. That’s the equivalent of 20 or so printed books, so if you wanted to pay just $1 per book-length section of blog inanity, you could easily justify a $20 donation.

And, if four more of you [donate to the Notes for Class Challenge](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=17149) before October 31, I’ll also create some new sections on my site to make it easier to find the stuff you’d actually want to read. Make me proud, people!
