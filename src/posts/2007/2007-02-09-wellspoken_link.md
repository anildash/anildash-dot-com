Okay, these are the links you should be reading on the Internet today.

- [A smart diagram is the new clever writing](http://thediagram.com/6_3/leisurearts.html): LeisureArts charts out my favorite snowclone. I covered similar topics before in [The Story of America](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/10/31/the_story_of_am) and [Do you love words?](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/02/19/do_you_love_wor) The diagram is excerpted here.
![Is The New](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/is-the-new.gif)
- The New York Times reports on [Justin Timberlake’s new audience](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/arts/music/07just.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=6f8bb9a230fdfd01&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink). “Unlike his former boy-band colleagues, Mr. Timberlake has even won over musicians who prefer lo-fi thrash to the slicker sounds of mainstream albums.” These hipsters could have been five years ahead of the curve if they’d just have listened to me.
- [Misidentified Black Person of the Week](http://undercoverblackman.blogspot.com/2007/02/misidentified-black-person-of-week.html). A disturbingly familiar story about mistaken captions, which references [my post about the same topic](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/12/08/ap_photo_captio) a couple of years ago. Somehow this really stuck with me, perhaps because I was reading [this cogent explanation of the problem with “articulate”](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/weekinreview/04clemetson.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=08be72bd34fa0898&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink) at the same time. “It is amazing that this still requires clarification, but here it is. Black people get a little testy when white people call them ‘articulate’.” So, two notes for editors: Get people’s names right, and be respectful. Not so hard!
- Speaking of respect, [Why didn’t Prince get electrocuted](http://www.slate.com/id/2159161/) while playing electric guitar in the rain at the Superbowl? Because he’s *Prince*, people!
- So it turns out there actually *may* be some [Hunanese origins for General Tso’s chicken](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/magazine/04food.t.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=4a1a8fda8e1c7043&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink). I’ve been using General Tso’s chicken as the definitive example of how I became clueful about eating good food (“It’s not even a real Chinese dish — I’m a dummy!”), but I like this story of how it’s a creation of cross-cultural entrepreneurism even better. I wonder if my family members in Taiwan have ever tried the “delectable concoction of lightly battered chicken in a chili-laced sweet-sour sauce”.
- I’m hoping danah won’t be offended if I call her [defense of walled gardens](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/02/05/about_those_wal.html) articulate. It’s also thought-provoking, which is high praise indeed.
- On the flip side of the walled garden conversation is [PB’s ongoing onfocus series](http://www.onfocus.com/2007/02/3925) about getting off the grid. The technology here is interesting, but I’m enjoying watching the thought process behind the coding that Paul has been doing.
- And finally, [Google is going to start to charge some businesses](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070206-8783.html) for [Google Apps for Your Domain](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/28/google_office_g). I find that refreshing and reassuring.
