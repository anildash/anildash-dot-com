[![NY Times Building](http://a3.vox.com/6a00b8ea067a51dece00cd97419ef34cd5-120si)](http://anil.vox.com/library/post/times-center.html) Pentagram, the designers of the website, signage, marketing materials, and stationery for the new [New York Times building](http://www.newyorktimesbuilding.com/), have a [fascinating blog post](http://blog.pentagram.com/archives/2007/07/sign_of_the_times.php) about the intricacies of the sign that theyâ€™ve created for the new Times Square skyscraper. The photo here is my cameraphone shot of the backside of the tower, taken when passing by yesterday.

And you thought this post was going to be about Prince.
