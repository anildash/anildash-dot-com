Before I crash for the night, I’d be remiss if I didn’t congratulate my incredibly talented and passionate coworkers and thank our unbelievable community. [Movable Type 4](http://www.movabletype.com/) is out the door. I think it’s the best product launch I’ve ever been involved in during my career, and I can’t wait to see the impressions of it six or twelve months down the road.

People who read this site probably know all about what a blogging platform does; You might be more interested in [Why we made MT4](http://www.movabletype.org/2007/08/why_we_made_movable_type_40.html) in the first place. (I should get bonus points for the old-school screenshot in that post.)
