Didja like the series of posts on [How to Visit New York City](/tag/howtonyc)? Then you might want to check these out:

- [Mark Dominus](http://blog.plover.com/food/nyc.html) has a lengthy, well-considered view of New York Tourism, centered around the maxim that I “…may be a little misleading when he says ‘the natives are friendly and helpful.’ I would say not. Neither are they unfriendly or unhelpful. What they mostly are, in my experience, is brusque and in a hurry.”
- And [Monsur](http://www.xanga.com/monsur/603835596/i-heart-ny.html) takes a run at the Apple, too: “New York City never ceases to surprise you. Toss aside the map, walk around, and let the city reveal herself to you.”
