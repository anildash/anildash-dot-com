Following up on [Indian Mango Alert Level: Orangish-Green](/2007/06/indian-mango-alert-level-orangishgreen.html) and [A Matter of National Security](/2007/06/a-matter-of-national-security.html), some data points:

- The [national flag of India](http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_flag.php) has stripes of orange and green on a white background, The orange (“deep saffron”) represents renunciation, and the green represents fertility.
- The U.S. [Homeland Security Advisory System](http://www.dhs.gov/xinfoshare/programs/Copy_of_press_release_0046.shtm) defines green on its scale as the color for a low threat level, with low risk of terrorist attack. Airports and New York City, where I live, are currently at threat level orange, which designates a high risk of terrorist attack.

Interestingly, as I was going to mention and [John Dowdell pointed out](/2007/06/a-matter-of-national-security.html#comment-201798), part of the ostensible reason for the reluctance to import Indian mangoes in the past was the risk of fruitfly larvae tagging along for the ride. The solution? A new irradiation process that kills the mango seed weevil. Kind of a nuclear security program for fruit.

If only that irradiation were powered by the nuclear fuel that India had gotten as part of its trade agreement with the U.S., we’d have a nice little circle of nuclear-mango life.
