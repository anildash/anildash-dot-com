Last year, when I wrote [Draw the Map, Draw the World](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/09/draw-the-map-dr.html) about the New York City subway map and Massimo Vignelli, one of the signature designers in the map’s history, I was surprised how many people were interested in the topic.

There’s been some great writing on Vignelli’s map:

- [Visual Complexity’s look at the map](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project_details.cfm?index=266&amp;id=266&amp;domain=), which I linked to last year, is wonderful.
- Design Observer offers [Mr. Vignelli’s Map](http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000218.html), which was published a few years ago in observance of the subway’s centennial.

But perhaps one of the coolest recent bits of media about Massimo Vignelli and his work on the subway map is [this outtake footage](http://www.helveticafilm.com/vignellimap.html) from the documentary film [Helvetica](http://www.helveticafilm.com/). It’s well worth a look for those enchanted with the fellow who said, [The only thing you are interested in is the spaghetti.](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/09/draw-the-map-dr.html)
