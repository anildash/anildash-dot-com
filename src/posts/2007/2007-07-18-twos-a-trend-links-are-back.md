- [Andre Torrez](http://notes.torrez.org/2007/07/the-return-of-l.html): “My little experiment in tossing links out of the main blog didn’t work out so hot. I like linking things, but I don’t like the lazy feeling of stuff just showing up here at some point in the day.”
- [Rafe Colburn](http://rc3.org/2007/07/yesterdays_link.php): “I still haven’t struck the balance I’d like between posting links and posting longer features here… So now my new idea is to post a wrapup of what I’m finding here every day or two in a more narrative form. This is the first attempt.”

Three’s a trend, too.
