I moved back to New York City at the end of last year because of [my wife’s work](http://www.seriouseats.com/), and despite my love for [my coworkers](http://www.sixapart.com/) and the work they do. But the decision was made really easy by the fact that I was spending too much time with other people in the Bay Area and especially in Silicon Valley who apparently have different motivations from my friends and peers.

[The New York Times gives us a depressingly close view](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/technology/05rich.html?ei=5088&amp;en=003719e2d0560842&amp;ex=1343966400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print) of the emptiness of their world. I struggle to find a nice way to say this, but if your motivation isn’t to [make something meaningful](/2006/07/05/making_somethin/), if you don’t understand what it is to [yearn for the creative impetus](http://bluishorange.com/?x=2007_07_01_archive.html#7937343896940110304) that is the core driver of interesting, meaningful, innovative work, or if your motivation is a big pile of money that won’t ever make your children happy, then I implore you, I *beseech* you: Get out now. Clear room again for those of us that do it because we love it, that did it when there was no money in it, that can’t *not* do it. Life’s too short to work on something so insufficiently world-changing. And you’re just getting in the way of those of us with work to do.
