If you’re in NYC, you should join me, and my friends from [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com/), [A Hamburger Today](http://aht.seriouseats.com/), and [Gothamist](http://www.gothamist.com/) for the [Burger Bash](http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2007/07/gothamistaht-saturday-burger-party.html) at Water Taxi Beach tomorrow. It’s going to be a pile of delicious burgers, accompanied by some good beer (first keg is free, courtesy of [my employers](http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2007/07/bloggers_burger.html)) and then later on, holy crap, Grandmaster Flash is spinning! What’s not to love?

The only tricky part is that you have to buy tickets in advance. [Go buy them now](http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;pl=&amp;eventId=198391), it’s only $13.50 and they’re even going to have **Butter Burgers**. Mmm, butter.
