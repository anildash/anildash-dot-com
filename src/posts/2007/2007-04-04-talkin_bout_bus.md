A couple of months ago, I got to talk to [Lynne](http://www.lynnedjohnson.com/) about business blogging for [Fast Company’s podcasts series](http://www.fastcompany.com/podcasts/player/inside012.html?partner=rss). I’m pretty happy with how it turned out, though the lasting lesson you might take away from the conversation is that I talk *really* fast. There’s a [downloadable MP3](http://media.inc.com.edgesuite.net/podcasts/fast-company/2007/inside012.mp3) of the conversation as well.
