I’ve found some nice responses to conversations I’ve had recently that are probably worth checking out.

First, and most importantly, **Soundwave: The Touch**, the story behind Soundwave’s omission from the recent Transformers movie.

Thanks to [Nima Yousefi](http://equinox-of-insanity.com/2007/08/soundwave-the-mp3-player/) for the link to this amazing work of art.

Meanwhile, over at InmanTV, I did a [brief interview on blogging](http://www.inmantv.com/?p=64) as part of their recent Bloggers Connect conference. And finally, [some notes from a conversation about journalists and blogging](http://time-blog.com/work_in_progress/2007/08/notes_from_times_blogging_tuto.html?xid=rss-wip), courtesy of Lisa Takeuchi Cullen.

The information in those final two links is pretty good, but really I just wanted to link to the video of Soundwave.
