Before it was called Firefox, or Firebird, Mozilla’s lightweight browser was known as Phoenix. An appropriate name, given than it rose from the ashes of Netscape. [Read/WriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/4_years_ago_today_netscape_foundation_born.php) has a nice retrospective pegged to the fourth anniversary of the creation of the Mozilla Foundation. It quotes me writing [upon the demise of Netscape](__GHOST_URL__/2003/07/15/upon_the_demise/), and I thought it was useful to also mention the [circle of web life](__GHOST_URL__/2007/01/17/its_the_circle/) that the Mozilla/Netscape browsers have been part of.

If you weren’t reading blogs back then, or missed the posts, some interesting related reading is [John Rhodes’ seminal essay about a Google client](http://webword.com/moving/googleclient.html) from 2001, as well as Jason Kottke’s [two](http://www.kottke.org/04/08/the-google-browser)[posts](http://www.kottke.org/04/09/more-google-browser) from 2004.

As Richard says in his R/WW post, “Life is all about cycles though, so whether the Google/Mozilla romance turns out to be comedy or tragedy in 4 more years time — that is the question.”
