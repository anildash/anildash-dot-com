Formidable geeks Aaron Swartz and Brewster Kahle have led a team of nerds to create [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/), which purports to be the start of a library of every book in the world. There’s a [demo](http://demo.openlibrary.org/) and [a vision statement](http://www.openlibrary.org/details/openlibrary), in the form of a book, naturally. And here’s [Tom Sawyer](http://openlibrary.org/details/adventuresoftoms00twaiuoft). That should keep you busy until the latest Harry Potter book is uploaded, which should happen any minute now.
