Following up on [Cats, Comics and Closure](/2007/04/cats-comics-and.html), [Meowchat and PetSpeak](/2007/04/meowchat-and-pe.html) (which, surprisingly, came up during [a panel on race and class](http://pdf2007.confabb.com/conferences/PDF2007/sessions/5556/details) on Friday), and of course [Cats can has grammar](/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html), I’ve rediscovered the bizarre things that happen after a couple hundred thousand people stumble across a blog post.

Chief among the unexpected results is that I’ve become a reluctant dumping ground for people who want to share their lol*whatever* sites with me. **Please note:** I am *not* asking you to send me more. Doesn’t mean I don’t like them, or that I won’t look at the links you send; Some of them are interesting. But, being fully employed, married, and relatively sane, I couldn’t possibly check out all the fascinating, inane, and useless web memes that have popped up around lolcats and image macros.

If you want to get a feel for what the realm looks like, here’s a random sampling:

- **Update:** I missed a good one, just published today. [Cat Power: You cannot resist lolcats](http://www.slate.com/id/2166338/) just went up on Slate, a meditation on the meme in the form of a slideshow. I even [got some props](http://www.slate.com/id/2166338/slideshow/2166369/fs/0//entry/2166376).
- [I Can Has Corgan](http://icanhascorgan.blogspot.com/), for fans of Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. Also the subject of a [Stereogum contest](http://www.stereogum.com/archives/photoshop-this/stereogums-lolzeitgeist-photo-contest.html).
- [I Has A Tardis](http://community.livejournal.com/ihasatardis/), for those interesed in Dr. Who cat macros.
- Research indicating that [emoticons are tied to cultural context](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WJB-4JT38WP-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=fdf2602bea942cf42f24c9e0647165b8). Duh! The [discussion on Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070514-emoticons-carry-cultural-baggage.html) is a little less dense than the [original research](http://lynx.let.hokudai.ac.jp/~myuki/paper/Yuki_Face_paper_JESP.pdf) [ (PDF format), but that one seemed like an obvious call.
- Unsettling Gawker fave Kreepie Kats ]() [considers the meme](http://gawker.com/news/kreepie-kats/u-cant-has-cheezburger-259653.php).
- And there’s even a nod in a recent episode of current geek-fave web comic [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/c262.html).
![ran out of staples](https://cdn.glitch.global/034ff067-8128-4744-8807-d19cee4142e7/in_ur_reality.png?v=1714969657834)

And that’s all I have to say about that subject for now.
