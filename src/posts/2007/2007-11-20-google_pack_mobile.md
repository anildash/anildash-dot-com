Google’s changed a lot in the past few years, going from underselling their efforts to shamelessly promoting themselves as leaders, even when it’s leadership over initiatives that are still very tenuous or nascent. The best example to me was looking at the Android effort, backed as it is by the grandly-named [Open Handset Alliance](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/index.html), and accompanied by a slickly-designed logo and some obviously careful branding work.

I can’t help but feel if Google had launched the exact same effort two or three years ago, it would have simply been called “[Google Pack](http://web.archive.org/web/20071118105751/http://pack.google.com/intl/en/pack_installer.html?hl=en&gl=us) Mobile”. I’m not sure that would have been any better, and it may well have been worse, but what’s remarkable is how complete the transformation has been.
