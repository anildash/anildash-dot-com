An interesting infographic trend: Square blocks of color are now being used to represent percentage-based statistics instead of the traditional pie chart. Some recent examples are shown here.
![Square Charts](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/square-graphs.png)

The chart on the left is from [a NY Times story on atheism and the afterlife](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/magazine/29wwln-lede-t.html?ref=magazine), making its choice of colors seem a little weird. And is that empty white block in the center supposed to represent the empty hole in our souls? On the right, a detail from a [Wired story on how much Americans spend on gadgets](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/15-08/st_infoporn). Charles M. Blow created the graphic for the Times; Arno Ghelfi did the honors for Wired.

This switch raises some interesting questions.

- Is the square format more familiar to readers now because of the preponderance of the pixel in pop culture?
- There’s a lot of leeway in choosing the shape of individual regions, since the only constraint is that they use the proper number of squares — what are the best practices here?
- Finally, a productive use of all that time spent playing Tetris?
- How come it took so long to figure out that pie charts are pretty hard to actually glean data from?
- Was there a “Designing For Print” conference somewhere six months ago where a speaker made a particularly compelling case for squares over circles?

Somewhat obliquely related, my series of posts last year on [100 Perfect Pixels](http://www.dashes.com/admin/mt/mt-search.cgi?tag=100px&amp;blog_id=1), featuring [Nike Plus](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/100-perfect-pix.html), [Amazon’s Gold Box](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/100-perfect-pix-1.html) and [Vox’s Neighborhood](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/100-perfect-pix-2.html).
