One of the reasons I admire my friend Mena is that she is remarkably prescient. I think it’s worth revisiting these posts that she wrote a year and a half ago.

Her first post was a [transcript of a speech](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/12/mena_trott_impl.html) she delivered, with the core concept that we should hold ourselves to the same standards in conversation online that we do face-to-face. Some key quotes:

> For this reason, many people are afraid of bloggers. Frankly, I’m a blogger and I’m afraid of bloggers…
> 
> If we want to bring a new generation to weblogging … we need to create an environment where people feel welcomed.

And then, her [follow-up post](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/12/words_you_shoul.html):

> There are really two points I want to emphasize.
> 
> - It’s not about being nice—it’s about accountability.
> - Ultimately, we need to get more people blogging.

I’d posted a bit about [the unkindness of our communities online](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/10/11/an_unkind_commu) as well. There’s more to come, but I think some of the ideas in all of these posts are still relevant.
