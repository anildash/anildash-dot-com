Are you in New York for the [PodCamp NYC conference](http://www.podcampnyc.org/)? Well, I’ll be there representing Six Apart and if you’re podcasting with Movable Type, TypePad, LiveJournal or Vox, then we should meet up. There are an astounding *twelve* simultaneous sessions taking place, so it’ll be impossible to get in touch with everyone in our community, but if you keep your eyes open in sessions like the 2:00PM “Blogging for Business” panel in the Kips Bay room, it should be easy to get in touch. You can also text me at 646-541-5843.

(And you can add the [Six Apart Twitter account](http://twitter.com/sixapart) or [my personal Twitter account](http://twitter.com/anildash) to your friends to get the latest updates.)
