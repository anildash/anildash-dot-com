We’re really close to [funding music education in Cassell Elementary School](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=95277&amp;challengeid=17149&amp;zone=0) in Chicago — you should contribute a couple of bucks! As [MetBlogs Chicago](http://chicago.metblogs.com/2007/10/04/donors-choose-the-south-side/) kindly mentioned, I am gonna match 10% of whatever you give. I promise I’ll get back to blogging about other topics as well next week, but I think there’s a really great chance to have a direct impact, and I hope you’ll join me.

Of course, if you [like any of the other proposals](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=17149) in the Notes for Class challenge, I’m happy to match those donations, too. One that jumped out at me is from right near my wife’s hometown: [Music Bingo](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=86910&amp;challengeid=17149&amp;zone=0) sounds like a great effort, at Salem Elementary School where they’re moving to a year-round class schedule and need some help to expand their lessons in the new schedule.
