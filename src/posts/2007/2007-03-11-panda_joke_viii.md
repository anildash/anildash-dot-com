It’s not the funniest joke in the world, but I’m very proud to have a tradition on my blog that is in its 8th annual incarnation, so here goes again: It’s the Panda joke!

A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders a sandwich. He eats the sandwich, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. As the panda stands up to go, the manager shouts, “Hey! Where are you going? You just shot my waiter, and you didn’t even pay for your sandwich!”

“Hey, man, I’m a PANDA!” the panda shouts back. “Look it up!”

The manager opens his dictionary and reads:
Panda:A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterized by distinct black and white coloring. Eats shoots and leaves.
Here’s the joke in [2006](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/03/12/panda_joke_vii), [2005](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/03/15/panda_joke_vi), [2004](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/03/12/panda_joke_v), [2003](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/03/08/panda_joke_iv), [2002](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/03/09/panda_joke), [2001](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/03/09/to_keep_you_bus), [2000](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2000/03/10/a_panda_walks_i). Phew, I’m getting old!
