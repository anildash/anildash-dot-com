Sure, Microsoft Word is fine for kids who want to write papers for school, but serious professionals should be *very* worried about using this dangerous tool! Just a few weeks ago, I found out about [this poor Des Moines woman](http://cbs4denver.com/watercooler/watercooler_story_020113911.html) fired for Wording at work!
**Three hundred single-spaced pages** of irresponsibility. Her name is Emmalee Bauer, so perhaps we should give her a verb — be careful with your word processor, or you could get *Emmaleed*™.

In completely, totally unrelated news, there was a nice [story about Vox](http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2007/02/even_the_new_yo.html) in the New York Times.
