From Paul Ford’s “[$5 Chocolate Bar](http://www.ftrain.com/five-dollar-chocolate-bar.html)“:

> Brooklyn has squandered the treasures she brought with her when she burst out of her father’s brain. She’s thinking, they took the fire from Prometheus and made ‘smores. And then–just a flicker out of the Gowanus and two man-shapes behind it. Something bright. A flash of cheer.

Paul Ford and I live a few miles apart in New York City, but we never really see each other. We grew up a few miles apart in Pennsylvania, but never met each other back then. He lived in [a town](http://web.archive.org/web/20071130011025/http://www.hersheypa.com/town_of_hershey/built_on_chocolate.html) where they make chocolate bars, and I bet some of ’em cost five bucks now.
