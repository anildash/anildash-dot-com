So, now that all the non-DRMed songs from the iTunes store will have [your name embedded in them](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/sorry%2C-pirates/drm+free-itunes-songs-have-embedded-user-info-264574.php) after download, how long until every illegally downloaded song’s ID3 tags have “mbainwol@riaa.org” in the metadata?
