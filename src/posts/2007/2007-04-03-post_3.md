[![Craig Robinson's pie chart](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/fff-personal-pies.png)](http://www.flipflopflyin.com/personalpies/index.html) Infographics and Peanut Butter week at dashes.com continues, this time with a terrific set of pie charts from Craig Robinson. You might know Craig as creator of [Flip Flop Flyin’](http://www.flipflopflyin.com/), whom we’ve loved for ages as creator of [minipops](http://www.flipflopflyin.com/minipops/index.html).

He’s done something great, though, with [Personal Pies](http://www.flipflopflyin.com/personalpies/index.html). Besides being entertaining, it’s doomed me forever to being cursed to think “That Flip Flop Flyin’ guy rubs ’em out to Madonna”. So there’s that.
