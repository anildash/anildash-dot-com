What a delight to be [interviewed by Bijan Stephens for Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/11/twitter-anil-dash), especially as so much of the focus was on me as a dad and a person, rather than just the usual tech stuff.

> In person, he projects an air of warm authority—more benevolent history teacher than shark-like C.E.O. This doesn’t stray far from his Twitter persona, which, even when he’s not tweeting explicitly about dad stuff, has the genial air of a one-time nerd aging into fatherhood and navigating the new, geek-friendly establishment.
