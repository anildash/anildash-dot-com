I got the chance to revisit some of the themes of [the Web We Lost](/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/) in the broader context of how we <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/notetoself/episodes/281706-planning-for-your-digital-life-after-death">confront our mortality and impermanence</a> in the digital realm <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/notetoself/articles/287072-tech-writer-anil-dash-web-we-lost">on WNYC</a> a few weeks ago.
