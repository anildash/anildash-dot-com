Listen, *I'm* not the one making this assertion. It's Vulture's daily 10x10 crossword puzzle for May 17th, entitled "The Sexual Tension Puzzle", in which I am, apparently, a clue. (Sorry to spoil the answer to 25 Across!) 

Don't believe me? [Check it out for yourself](https://www.vulture.com/2022/05/crossword-the-sexual-tension-puzzle.html). Thanks so much to [Malaika Handa](https://www.girlbosswords.com/about.html) for this delightful absurdity!
