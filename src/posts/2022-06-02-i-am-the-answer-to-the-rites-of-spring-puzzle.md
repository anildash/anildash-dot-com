Somehow, improbably, I am *again*[referenced in a crossword puzzle](__GHOST_URL__/2022/05/20/i-am-the-answer-to-the-sexual-tension-puzzle/), this time it was the Sunday Boston Globe from back on April 17th. This time, I have [Joon Pahk ](https://twitter.com/joonpahk/status/1515722678459678721)to thank!

Who knew there were so many small fringe benefits to having a four-letter name with two non-consecutive vowels? I'd also like to take a moment to mock all of the other Anils of the world, who may be more worthy of acknowledgement, but whose last names may be less likely to fit into a small list of puzzle clues.
