Thank you to those of you who [supported my bid for a board seat](/2010/12/13/im_running_for_the_new_york_tech_meetup_board) in the New York Tech Meetup election. Being considered amongst such talented and accomplished peers is an honor, and being elected from among them is even more so, especially alongside [Evan Korth](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~korth/).

I’m looking forward to getting to work on helping serve the community. And I want to emphasize how important the work of the Tech Meetup itself is, because the elections frankly aren’t that significant in the greater context of the community — the [low turnout of voters](http://www.observer.com/2010/media/anil-dash-tk-win-new-york-tech-meetup-board-election) demonstrates that well. I’m not that troubled by the small number of votes, as I believe it reflects the fact that people see NYTM as a value primarily for the connections and opportunities it affords between members and attendees, and thus rightly avert their focus from the machinations of the organization’s infrastructure.

That being said, I’m excited to be part of that infrastructure, and look forward to doing my small part as one of the members of an [exceptional board](http://nytm.org/the-board/). My immediate priorities are to try to help the NYTM community be more inclusive and more effective in its goals, and I hope those of you with ideas on how to do so (including my fellow candidates) will share those ideas both online and in person.
