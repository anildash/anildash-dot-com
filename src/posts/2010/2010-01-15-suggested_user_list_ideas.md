A few weeks ago when I started writing about [what it‚Äôs like to be on Twitter‚Äôs suggested user list](/2009/12/29/life_on_the_list) and the fact that [nobody has a million followers on Twitter](/2010/01/05/nobody_has_a_million_twitter_followers), I thought it might be a good opportunity to try to collect some useful data since I‚Äôd been logging my account‚Äôs activity using Gina Trapani‚Äôs [ThinkTank application](http://thinktankapp.com/). So I offered an Amazon gift certificate as a little token prize to encourage everybody to chip in ideas of how to analyze that data.

As my follower count crept past 300,000 a number of you responded with suggestions of what information you were curious about, submitting your ideas by using the [#sulidea](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23sulidea) hashtag.

Before I reveal who‚Äôs won an Amazon certificate, here‚Äôs a list of all of the suggestions that I found, sorted by Twitter user name.

1. [casey](http://twitter.com/aerogare): I wonder what the rate of increase of followers for those on the SUL is‚Äîi.e., is there a spike on day 1 and then dropping each day?
2. [Alex Guest](http://twitter.com/AlexGuest): How many followers from pre-list days are still following and what is the decay curve?
3. [Carol Hagen](http://twitter.com/carolhagen): Interested in stats on new followers & avg number of tweets from lists vs those of engaged followers
4. [Nate](http://twitter.com/chenenko): How many of your SUL followers have less than 10 total tweets after their first three months on twitter?
5. [Chris F. Nicholson](http://twitter.com/chrisFnicholson): How many of your followers follow a given number of your other followers (how deep is the network between them, and thus, you)

8. [Tim Maly](http://twitter.com/doingitwrong): What proportion of your followers go on to become disabled accounts? We‚Äôre looking for spammers.
9. [Doug Benson](http://twitter.com/DouglassBenson): We need a way to know who is an expert and who is a twitter fool. Is there any kind of feedback metric other than followers?
10. [Ekalavya](http://twitter.com/ekalavyab): Wonder how many users who‚Äôve followed you after you got listed on the list will send in suggestions?
11. [Phil Wolff](http://twitter.com/evanwolf): How are the people who followed you before & after different, adjusted for time on T? # of followers, tweets, followeds?

23. [Jon Paul](http://twitter.com/JonPaul2012): punk your followers with outrageous tweets w/ links, and see how many take the bait. Determine if lack of clicks was them or you üòâ
24. [Katie Kimball](http://twitter.com/KitchenStew): How did YOU get on the list?

26. [Michael Kubler](http://twitter.com/kublermdk): Are new followers not clicking/retweeting cause they are new? Do old followers used to Twitter do better?
27. [Leonard](http://twitter.com/lhl): analysis of followers quantifying activity percentiles / current activity also would be pretty useful

51. [David Wertheimer](http://twitter.com/werty): And idea 3 (best) re : I suspect the average Suggested User user is simply more likely to be a lurker than ‚Äòs usual coterie
52. [J. D. J.](http://twitter.com/zanson): I‚Äôd be interested in knowing what percentage of your followers have ever @mentioned you.

Since there were lots of good ideas, I‚Äôve decided to give out two awards, one for the most universal, and one for the most thought-provoking.

[Nate Chenenko asked](http://twitter.com/chenenko), ‚ÄúHow many of your SUL followers have less than 10 total tweets after their first three months on twitter?‚Äù I think this is the fundamental question. Are people who follow someone on the suggested user list interested in posting to Twitter at all? Is it just a passive experience for them? [Ricardo Guerrero](http://twitter.com/ggroovin) formulated this in terms of time period of activity instead of tweet count, which is similar but slightly less indicative, when he asked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be keen to know how many of your followers haven‚Äôt updated at all in the last 1-3 months. Also % who‚Äôve replied/RTed.‚Äù And [Jay Neff](http://twitter.com/JayNeff) phrased it as, ‚ÄúWhat % of follows gained are actively tweeting? Would love to see a breakdown of active to inactive over x amount of time‚Äù So Ricardo and Jay get Honorable Mentions, along with a few others who asked similar questions, while Nate gets a prize.

And [Sharon Henry](http://twitter.com/sharonhenry101) gets a prize for articulating another common theme in an interesting way: ‚ÄúBreakdown of your followers: Those following fewer than 50,100‚Ä¶being 1 of 50 greater influencer than being 1 of 10,000 ‚Äú. That seems eminently doable, so I really found it appealing. In short, what I‚Äôm hoping for is two core bits of data from which we can extrapolate a lot of meaning:

- How many followers do each of *my* followers have?
- How many tweets do each of my followers have, and when was the last time they were active?

Those are pretty straightforward requests to make with the Twitter API. So, there‚Äôs still a chance to win another prize. If you‚Äôre a coder, commit either of those queries as a feature built onto [ThinkTank](http://thinktankapp.com/) and I‚Äôll send you a [500 GB portable hard drive](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CJAZC6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=2020-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001CJAZC6).

Thanks to everybody who participated! I‚Äôll try to make the data from these requests available as soon as possible, and the few questions above that I have answers to will be replied to shortly.
