I struggled for a long time when the nice folks at the [Heat Rocks podcast](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/heat-rocks) asked me which Prince album I’d want to talk about on their show. Oliver Wang and Morgan Rhodes run an amazing podcast, where every episode is a deep-dive into a classic album.

Ultimately, because of its significance and relative lack of prominence amongst casual fans, I settled on Prince’s 1982 classic, *1999*. In the finished show, we talk about everything from how Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson were influenced by the sound of *1999* to my own personal revelations about faith, as inspired by discovering that Prince didn’t actually write the Lord’s Prayer.
