It's happened *again*! I'm an answer in today's Daily Crossword Puzzle over at Vulture, called <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2023/08/daily-crossword-puzzle-august-8.html">The Single Puzzle</a>

This is thanks (once more) to Malaika Handa, <a href="/2022/05/20/i-am-the-answer-to-the-sexual-tension-puzzle/">seen previously</a> in one of my earlier crossword appearances. Yes, this somehow happens <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2022/06/02/i-am-the-answer-to-the-rites-of-spring-puzzle/">fairly regularly</a>.
