Amongst the many new publications that's popped up in the current newsletter boom, I've been enjoying Kate Lindsay and Nick Catucci's "Embedded". One of the biggest reasons why is the recurring feature "My Internet", which details the way one person uses all the common aspects of the internet that we all manage every day. And this time around, I got to be the guest for My Internet!

Do [check out the Q&A](https://embedded.substack.com/p/my-internet-anil-dash), and then be sure to stop off and subscribe to Embedded as well. Here's one answer that represents the whole thing pretty well:

***Have you ever had a post go viral? What was that experience like?***

> Yyyyeah, it’s bad. Like, many years ago (I think it was 2007?) [I wrote a blog post about some of the earliest memes](/2007/04/23/cats_can_has_gr/), like LOLcats. Somehow it caught on, and got shared, and something like a million people read it. The same thing happened a few years ago when [I wrote about JOMO](/2012/07/19/jomo/), the Joy of Missing Out. And every time something like that gets big, there’s all these folks that want you to turn it into a whole thing, to pimp your viral crap on some TV show, or churn out a quick book about it, and it’s all such schlocky garbage. I think a big reason I’ve been able to stay sane despite being on social media for 20 years is always having resisted becoming one of those one-trick-pony meme people.
