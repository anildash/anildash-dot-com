I saw yesterday that Sunil had posted [a bunch of info about X-10 pop-ups](http://widepipe.org/archives/00000030.shtml), which are horrendous ads for a pretty cool technology that has recently [seduced Matt](http://www.hit-or-miss.org/post/982).

Fortunately for [Oliver](http://members.home.net/ow1977/2001_05_01_archives.html#3874575), included among those links was one where you can [disable those ads](http://www.x10.com/x10ads.htm) for thirty days.
