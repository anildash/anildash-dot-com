So AOL’s [Digital City](http://www.digitalcity.com/newyork/) here in New York has a [Concierge Service](http://home.digitalcity.com/newyork/vip/?_dci_e_t=incoming&amp;_dci_a_l=digitalcityconcierge%2evipdesk%2ecom%2fabout%5fservice%2easp%3fcity%3dNew%20York), courtesy of some startup called [VIP Desk](http://www.vipdesk.com/).

I wanted to give them a good test, so I went to the service asking for the location of a coal-fired brick oven pizza shop here on the Upper East Side. I know of one in Midtown, and of course I know of [Grimaldi’s](http://www.grimaldis.com/), which is the best pizza in the world. (They’re in Brooklyn.) But is there one near me?

Let’s find out.
