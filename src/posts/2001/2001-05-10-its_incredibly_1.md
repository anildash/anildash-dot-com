It’s incredibly inaccurate to name a site [BitchLog](http://www.jenifer.net/) when the site’s proprietor is as sweet and kind as Jenifer has been to me. But it’s a catchy name, and, even better, I’ve been **friendship crushed**. I don’t know what it is, but people are just overflowing with kindness for me these days, and it’s much appreciated. At any other point in my life, I’d be spoiled. But I’ve needed the boost recently, and people have come out in droves to make my day.

Separate from Jen’s generosity in the crush department, [TrustFest 2001](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_05_01_archive.php#3538696) continues with my Amazon Friends list growing to include [Lia](http://www.cheesedip.com), [James](http://www.consolationchamps.com) and [Dinah](http://www.metagrrrl.com). And [Cam](http://www.camworld.com) gets extra-special first-class linky love, for reasons that I am not yet able to disclose.

Oh, and I’m completely slack-jawed, weak-kneed, head-over-heels smitten with [Saima](http://www.saimasays.com) and her gorgeous, unfairly attractive voice, even though we’ve never met. That’s such a geek thing, to be smitten with someone who you only know through her website. But, well… I’m a geek.

Oh, and don’t tell her. It’s a secret. Springtime is a good time for crushes.
