I was looking back at my comments [here on my blog](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2000_09_01_archive.php#849701) and on the [MetaFilter thread](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/3270) because of a few conversations with friends the past few days. So, I hacked around and made this [Napsearch](javascript:q=(document.frames.length?'':document.selection.createRange().text);for(i=0;i<document.frames.length;i++){q=document.frames[i].document.selection.createRange().text;if(q!='')break;}if(q=='')void(q=prompt('Enter Napster search words.',''));if(q)location.href='nap:search?artist='+escape(q)) bookmarklet. (Just drag to your toolbar, [yada, yada, yada…](http://www.bookmarklets.com))

I’m still testing it, so don’t blame me if it ain’t perfect yet, but it should get you started. Coming up next: an automated script to perform a series of Napster searches. And more research into [AIM URLs](aim:goim?screenname=anildash&amp;message=Yo!), including whether I finally find out how to add a buddy through a URL. I can already trigger a message, invite someone to a chat, and a few other things…
