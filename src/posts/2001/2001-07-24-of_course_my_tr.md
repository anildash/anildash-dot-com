Of course, my true love, as always, are AIM bots, so I was pleased to [find out](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/9214) that there is an AIM [Googlebot](aim:goim?screenname=googlematic&amp;message=anil). His name is Googlematic, and he was made by [Matt Webb](http://www.interconnected.org/home/). Matt’s explained how it works on his site, but its simplicity is even more apparent from [his MeFi post](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/9214#112671).

I mention all of this purely for [Andre](http://www.torrez.org)‘s benefit. More bots coming up soon…
