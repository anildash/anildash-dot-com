I love [Brill’s Content](http://www.brillscontent.com/current/index.shtml), been a reader since the first issue. Now [Matt](http://a.wholelottanothing.org)‘s on the cover, and I couldn’t have been more excited. Rock Star Matt.

But.

But they accompanied the whole thing with [an article on Melanie Griffith’s website](http://www.brillscontent.com/2001may/features/web_stars.shtml). Argh. I know i’ve mentioned this [before](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_03_01_archive.php#2937043), but why is this happening? Can’t they see that she’s evil?
