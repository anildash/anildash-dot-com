As I’m super busy with a work project (if there are roughly 20 blank pages in next week’s Village Voice, you’ll know I didn’t succeed.) I’ve taken a guest host for today, my friend Jon. He says:

> Don’t let Anil’s ethnic background fool ya — he would just as soon throw a cow into a flash fryer as hold it sacred. As christmas is full of sexual allusion (yule log anyone?), we were both curious as to whether or not this infamous [holiday sweetmeat](http://freebiesandstuff.freeyellow.com/christmas/mincemeat-pie.html) was really any good.

So, what’s the word on pastry con carne? Is mincemeat pie edible?
