Odd. I was browsing around my [Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/2445HGNSNLOHF/103-0282286-9054214?add-fav=1), as I do sometimes, picking items off of friends’ and acquaintances’ wish lists, when I discovered, thanks to [Chason](http://chason.nulldesign.com/)‘s help, that adding someone as a "trusted friend" sends then an email alerting them to their newly-upgraded status.

This discovery left me mortified, as I’ve added virtual strangers, even *complete* strangers to my list, and sometimes bumped them up to Trusted status, either due to whim or some arbitrary justification. The same way I tend to pick people at random and buy them things off their wish lists when I get bummed out.

But now, I’m thinking that people must get these weird emails and wonder, “Who the hell *is* this guy?” Afraid that I’ve mistaken them for close friends. This mental image left me bemused and chagrined. It would have been the zenith of my embarrassment, except that I had another realization…

I’ve never gotten one of those notifying emails before. No one trusts me.
