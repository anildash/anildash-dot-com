In an interesting divergence from the "the logo in the upper-left corner takes you to the homepage" convention that has been with the web for years now, [CNET](http://www.cnet.com) has linked the logo on their homepage to the [CNET Insider column](http://www.cnet.com/insider/0-121949.html?st.cn.1.yhed.121949) which offers weekly highlights of content across the site.

I think it’s a good idea, and a useful evolution. The only slight confusion would be if a user is on the homepage and clicks on the logo, it doesn’t keep them in place. But I’m suspecting that most people who come to the CNET homepage go there either through a bookmark or by typing it in, so this redefinition of a de facto standard is a great way to expose site functionality and enhance the discoverability.
