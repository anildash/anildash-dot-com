These [rejected Zagat’s](http://www.zagat.com/help/outtakes_1.asp)[restaurant reviews](http://www.zagat.com/Help/outtakes.asp) are gut-bustingly funny. Especially if you can figure out what a quote like “Should be renamed Barfing Dog” is [referring to](http://www.zagat.com/search/Details.asp?RID=11801).
