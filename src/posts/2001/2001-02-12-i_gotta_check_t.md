I gotta check this out later: [CodeCharge](http://www.webtools.com/story/general_scripting/TLS20010209S0001), which is supposed to let you specify the functionality of a web app you’re creating, and it’ll spit out the requisite code in either ASP, ColdFusion, PHP, JSP, or Perl. Now I’m struggling to get all of those installed on my little laptop here so I can compare. The first three are already done…
