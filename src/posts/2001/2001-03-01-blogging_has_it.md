**Blogging has its rewards.** I’ve gotten:

- My [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) stickers. (I’d scan them, but they look just like the Blogger logo.)
- A [spatula](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004OCL8/ref=cm_mp_wl/104-2881473-1034313?colid=2445HGNSNLOHF)
- A check for $241.13 from [Epinions](http://anildash.epinions.com)

But I do it for the love of the game, you know.
