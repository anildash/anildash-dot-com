I’m probably pretty busy right now, having just gotten to Austin and SXSW last night. I’m writing this post a few days ago so that the site will update itself… in the meantime, you can go look at [this essay](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_02_01_archive.php#2654597) I wrote, but didn’t publish, last month. It’s a little more lengthy and introspective than what I usually write.

But it’s me, so I guess it belongs here.
