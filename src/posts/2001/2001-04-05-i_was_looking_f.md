**"I was looking for a book on disposing of a body, but this should do just fine."** It’s all well and good to be smart and nice. But funny, too? [Andre’s Wish List](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/278OE3EPKXB5M/107-7776270-4133356) makes me wish I had a job so I could buy him something, just for the entertainment value of the list itself.

It leads to another idea, too… something about Six Degrees of Amazon Wishlists. Guess how many clicks from me to Jeff Bezos?
