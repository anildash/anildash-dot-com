Here in Manhattan, the City takes it upon itself to suspend the [Street Parking Rules](http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/dot/html/travroad/scrintro.html) whenever it snows, in addition to the usual holiday calendar. This suspension is duly noted by local radio stations, which announce the changes in the same way that school delays are announced. Well, maybe it’s due to the fact that I don’t listen to the radio much anymore, but apparently I missed the **Bra-Optional Day** announcement for today.

Granted, it is about 90 degrees Fahrenheit out there, but it seemed, especially later in the afternoon, to be a bit untoward out there.

Ahhh, summer in the city.

How annoying is it when the straps are digging into your shoulders on a hot, sticky day?
