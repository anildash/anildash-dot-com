Sorry for the lack of updates, I’ve been out having a life. As it turns out, **I like people better than websites**. And I’ve been spending a lot of time in the past few days and weeks with couples that were either married, engaged, or seriously committed, as chance and our antiquated laws allow. It seems that springtime is still a wonderful time to be in love, even vicariously.

On the other hand, liking people *and* websites aren’t mutually exclusive. I’ve had the good luck to get back in touch with several old friends in the past week, and I know at least a few of ’em did some background research on me either through Google, this site, or both. Now if I can just convince my sister, after years of harranguing her, to get online, I’ll be all set.
