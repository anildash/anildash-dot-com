In response to a coupla emails, here is the **setlist for Living Colour’s performance** yesterday:

> Ignorance is Bliss
> 
> Sacred Ground
> 
> Middle Man
> 
> Trance
> 
> Time’s Up
> 
> Papa Was a Rolling Stone (Temptations Cover)
> 
> Elvis is Dead (With “Can’t Help Falling In Love” interlude)
> 
> Type
> — *break* —
> 
> Love Rears Its Ugly Head
> 
> Cult of Personality
> — *break* —
> 
> Tower of Soul (Hendrix cover)
> 
> American Skin (Springsteen cover)

A pretty standard set, but the highlight was definitely the closing cover of Springsteen’s [*American Skin*](http://www.springstomania.com/06.html) Haunting and delicate, it evoked both the Boss’ original and his older standard *The River*, along with echoes of *Purple Rain*. I’m hoping to dig up an MP3 of their version somewhere online.

You can see a [schedule of their upcoming dates](http://www.willcalhoun.com/tourschedule.shtml) on drummer Will Calhoun’s site. **Go see ’em**, you’ll like it.
