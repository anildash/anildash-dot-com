As a follow-up on yesterday’s [tool for Outlook 2002’s Attachment security settings](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_04_01_archive.php#3082119), you can also check out the [official Microsoft tool](http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/appndx/appa11.htm) for making these changes. I haven’t tried it myself yet, but I’m sure it’s a better fit for corporate situations, especially if Exchange is running on the server.

One of many wonderful and exciting new toys, tools and delightful surprises, all brought to you as part of the [Marvelous Microsoft Office XP Resource Kit](http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/xp/default.htm).
