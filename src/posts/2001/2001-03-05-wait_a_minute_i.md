Wait a minute, I was going to kiss [Dan](http://www.lakefx.nu)‘s ass again for his incredible scholarship recently at both Lake Effect and on MetaFilter. But then I went to look at his [profile page at MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/user.mefi/654), and I saw that he’s posted ***1665* comments** at MeFi. My god! Sure, lots of research makes for great posts, but how can you have both quantity *and* quality? It’s just not right.
