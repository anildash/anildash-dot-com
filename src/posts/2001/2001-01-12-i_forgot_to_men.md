I forgot to mention that [Jon](http://www.viama.co.uk/blog/index.htm) told me a couple of days ago about a site that details [Web Ad Blocking](http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~atman/spam/adblock.shtml) on lots of different browsers and platforms. I wasnâ€™t really focusing on *blocking* ads so much as preventing them from launching pop-ups, but this is an even more complete solution.
