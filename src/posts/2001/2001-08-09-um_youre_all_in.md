Um, you’re all incredible sweethearts for emailing me, but when I was talking about the [volume control](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_08_01_archive.php#4982124), I meant that I wanted to just point at the yellow speaker icon in the taskbar system tray (well, the icon is black in Windows XP) and **roll the mouse wheel up and down to change volume**.

I do know that I can single-click on the volume control and get a slider which responds to the wheel, but then I have to change focus and all that other terrible stuff. I just want it to know I’m pointing at it and respond. Is that so much to ask?
