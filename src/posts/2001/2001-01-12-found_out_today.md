Found out today about this CD called [Dreamworld: Essential Late Night Listening]([http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?userid=3T19YX64RK&sourceid=00002634292284500056&bfdate=01-12-2001](http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?userid=3T19YX64RK&amp;sourceid=00002634292284500056&amp;bfdate=01%2D12%2D2001) 02%3A41%3A23&ean=49925113426), and the strange thing about the compilation is that damn near every song on there is my favorite on the album from which it originates. Which is to say, I’ve succeeded in outsourcing my mix CD’s, I guess. Go get it!
