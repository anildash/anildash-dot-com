So I was going to make a right-drag context menu extension for making [NTFS Junctions](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_01_01_archive.php#1861837), but someone already did it, and even better, [told *how* he did it](http://www.codeproject.com/shell/shellextguide4.asp?print=true). And then I discovered there was no executable to download. Poop.
