So, yeah, [Jason](http://q.queso.com/2001/05/31) is the proud host of [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com) now, and, through the magic of **QuesoVision**, you can watch him set up the MeFi box here in New York in [vibrant, living color](__GHOST_URL__/anil/stuff/quesovision.gif).

There’s something surreal about watching someone a mile away set up a computer that was shipped across a continent. I just regret that I couldn’t have been there to plug the thing in myself. I will definitely go and visit soon. And Jason, take your coffee off of the machine, okay?
