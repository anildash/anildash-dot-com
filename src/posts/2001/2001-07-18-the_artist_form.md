The Artist Formerly Known as Terence Trent D’Arby (no, really, he goes by “Sananda Maitreya” now…) is [still pretty](http://www.prosieben.de/images/magazin/music/terence/SMIndoor021_680_480.jpg). And [Claire](http://www.loobylu.com/) has returned to making pretty stuff herself. I’m glad to have her back.
