It looks like most people would **pay the same amount yearly** for [Microsoft Office](http://cgi.zdnet.com/zdpoll/question.html?pollid=20754&amp;action=a) as they would for [Blogger](http://tools.arsdigita.com/voxpopuli/ViewResults?poll_id=2836&amp;poll_question_id=2915). And while writing this, I’ve realized that I use Blogger a *lot* more than I use Microsoft Office. Now I just want an API for Blogger so I can make my living customizing it, like I used to do with customizing Office.

Oh, to vote for how much you’d pay for Office, [go here](http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/stories/story/0,10738,2679248,00.html?chkpt=zdhpnews02), and you can vote on Blogger [right here](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?proinfo.php#pricing).
