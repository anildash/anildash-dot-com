An excellent writeup of the [Web Services](http://www.stencilgroup.com/ideas_scope_200106wsdefined.html) arena. Particular highlights: the diagram showing the [Web Services Technology Stack](http://www.stencilgroup.com/ideas_scope_200106wsdefined.html#wsstack) and the [Web Services FAQ](http://www.stencilgroup.com/ideas_scope_200106wsdefined.html#wsfaq).

My recommendation? Make a folder called “Explanations” (or something like that) under your Favorites menu. Add those links, and [Tomalak’s Realm](http://www.tomalak.org) and add in anything else that you’ll need in the future to jog your memory. I’m sure you’ve got some great explanatory sites of your own; [what did I forget](javascript:viewComments(5187193))? ( echo commentCount(5187193); ?>)
