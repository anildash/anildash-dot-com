So I’m still pretty shell-shocked. I got tired of the incessant TV buzz, and said “enough of this, I have to go out and get some fresh air, clear my head.” I walked by my closet on the way out (keep in mind, a small Manhattan studio apartment) and the shelf and bar holding most of the contents of the closet collapsed. Somewhere around 90% of my worldly possessions spilled out onto the floor, and all of supports for the shelf are ripped out of the wall.

The universe has a pretty dark sense of humor. I am just hoping to have all of this stuff reassembled and pakced away before a couple of friends who are mass transit refugees arrive to sleep here for the night. I think the final thing to collapse today will be me.
