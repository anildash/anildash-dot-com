Thinkin’ about [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/). From beautiful, [cutting-edge](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/) ideas to [brilliant recastings](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/practicalcss/) of the familiar, profound in their simplicity, the way we make the web is changing. Things will start to work the way they’re ought to, because pages will be written and designed they they were supposed to be.

If you have access to a Windows machine and you want to work with CSS, you owe it to yourself to get a copy of [TopStyle](http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp). Especially since, if you register right now, [all of the proceeds will go to the Red Cross](http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/order/disaster.asp). TopStyle is made by Nick Bradbury, the fellow behind HomeSite on the PC, back when it was a simple, elegant text-based editor. Which is, not coincidentally, what TopStyle is for CSS today. Augment TopStyle with the [IE Stylesheet Browser](http://www.nodntap.com/misc/stylesheet_browser.shtml), which extends Internet Explorer to include many new, useful functions for viewing and manipulating style sheets.

Once you’re on your way, you’ll need a few sites for guidance. You can’t do better than the resources assembled at a few key places on the net: Eric Meyer’s [CSS layout techniques](http://www.glish.com/css/), BlueRobot.com’s [layout reservoir](http://www.bluerobot.com/web/layouts/), and the [TopStyle general support newsgroup](news://news.bradsoft.com/topstyle.support.general).

And don’t just read it, *live* it. The work project that has kept me from updating this site for most of the past week only uses  tags for —*gasp*— tables.
