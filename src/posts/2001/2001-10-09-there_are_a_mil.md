There are a million different ways in which life has changed. I’ve been looking for an apartment here in the city for the past short while, which you’ve probably noticed if you ever glance over at my sidebar. It’s something of a standard in New York City when indicating the age of an apartment building, especially a walk-up building, to mention whether the building is [pre-war](http://www.manhattanapts.com/rentalfacts/buildings.html#prewar) or [post-war](http://www.manhattanapts.com/rentalfacts/buildings.html#postwar). I suppose it’s a reflection of how building codes changed during the 1940s, and how standards for design changed.

But the unfortunate realization I’ve come to these past few days is that, with our new perspective, I see *every* standing building in this city as pre-war.
