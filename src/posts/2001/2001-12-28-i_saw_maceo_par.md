I saw [Maceo Parker](http://maceo.com) last night, and he was funky as all get out. Granted, he wasn’t as ass-kicking as the first time I saw him, but that may have been due at least partially to the exasperatingly unfunky crowd.

Still, I’d recommend checking him out if he comes to your town; tour dates are on his website, linked above.
