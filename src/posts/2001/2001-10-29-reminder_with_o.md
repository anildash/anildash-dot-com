**Reminder:** With only about two months to go, *now* is the time to download all your favorite Christmas novelty songs and start playing them for your co-workers. Besides the inevitable “Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer”, I’d recommend “The 12 Pains of Christmas” and Wings’ “Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time”.

As the Jolly Green Giant said, “Ho Ho Ho!”

Just think, in only a month from now, the strains of Adam Sandler’s “Hanukkah Song”, parts 1 and 2, will be inducing thoughts of suicide in otherwise-sane people all over the country. Even better will be the use of oblique references to the terrorist attacks to convince people that we ought to (1) shop ourselves into debt and (2) somehow incorporate *more* mindless, archaic religion in our lives. It’s so horribly backwards, it’s got to be Holiday Magic!

Wednesday’s forecast? Cloudy with a chance of brimstone!
