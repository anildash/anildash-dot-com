Although I’m naturally in favor of stronger parent-child relationships, I am a bit skeptical about the newest organization that has formed to promote them. Ladies and gentlemen, I present the [With Arms Wide Open Foundation](http://www.witharmswideopen.org/).

Yes, *that* "With Arms Wide Open". As in [Creed](http://www.creednet.com/). I don’t mean to be flippant, but isn’t that kind of like starting the [Roll To Me Institute](http://www.delamitri.com/)?
