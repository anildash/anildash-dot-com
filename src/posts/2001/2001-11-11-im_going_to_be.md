I’m going to be offline for a few days as I move to my new apartment. You can take this opportunity to [fill my inbox with love](mailto:anil@dashes.com?subject=I%20Love%20You), or you can just chat amongst yourselves.

Also, just for reference:

Number of subway posters I saw today advertising Britney Spears’ upcoming [concert on HBO](http://www.hbo.com/britney/): **5**

Number of subway posters for the concert which had mustaches drawn onto Britney’s face with black marker: **5**.
