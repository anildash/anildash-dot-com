[Thirteen](http://www.13labs.com) is my friend:

> I picked up a respirator, as my little surgical masks are not equal to the onslaught of dust I kick up in my manly work. I had found a nice econo-respirator, when I noticed the deluxe version was $1.19 more. What kind of cheap bastard does not upgrade a buck for his lungs? Not me, I now own a nicer respirator than you jerkass.
