I’ve never been much of one for feeling guilty, but I fear I have finally upset the delicate sensibilities of [Ms. Champ](http://www.harrumph.com/010422.html), whom I honestly hold in nothing but the highest regard. And not just because she’s down with [Derek](http://www.powazek.com). You see, I’ve kicked the dead comedic horse that is the anti-Canadian joke just a few times too many, and now she’s vented in some sort of final, let’s-get-it-all-out spasm of Canadian jokes. The unfortunate reality, though, is that I have already moved past the [litany of obvious jokes](http://www.blogvoices.com/tools/blogvoices.bv?BlogID=530840&amp;Permalink=3323987) about them, and embraced them as brothers and sisters.

I love Canada. Some of my best friends are Canadian.
