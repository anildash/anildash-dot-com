I got a message today from my friend Glenn, who is part of the team responsible for the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/today/) website, and it made me think of **what a formidable task** it would be to try to make a web interface to all that information. Especially on a publicly-funded budget.

But they’ve done a pretty successful job of it, although I do have a few minor quibbles with the accessibility and usability (or lack thereof) of the site.

Now if they can just scan all of the archives and post ’em in Acrobat format, we’ll be all set.
