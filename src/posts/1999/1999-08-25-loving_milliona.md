Talk about your **guilty pleasures**… I’m not much of TV person, but if you gotta watch, one might as well watch [Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?](http://www.abc.go.com/primetime/millionaire/play.html). From its catchy, fifties-meets-nineties name, to the fact that it has that way over the top music and set lighting, it’s some damn compelling programming.

It also confirms the suspicion I’ve always had that **Regis Philbin is not a bad guy**. Especially since Kathy Lee is nowhere around. Did you know Regis plays tennis with Seal? It’s true. Now if I can just talk him into getting me onto that show.

Of course, it costs $1.50 US to call up to be on the show. Think between that and the ad revenue they’re making money? *Hand over fist*, I’d bet. Now I just have to figure out how to get them to **give the million bucks to me**…
