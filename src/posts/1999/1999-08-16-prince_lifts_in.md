**Separated at birth?** The opening bars of Stevie Wonder’s "You Are the Sunshine of My Life" features vocals being handed off from a male vocal to a female and finally to Stevie himself. Prince’s "1999" features **the same technique**, from Dez Dickerson to Lisa Coleman to Prince himself.

All the reports from the time of the recording of "1999" indicate that it was originally recorded as a group vocal, but ***something*** made Prince change his mind during the mixing of the song…

Just some food for thought.
