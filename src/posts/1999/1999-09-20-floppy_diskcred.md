Another downside to the [Tulip Bubble](http://www.itulip.com) mentality saturating the industry is the "Why are they making all the money, I should have thought of that!" reaction I keep having to every **innovative, creative** new idea that comes along.

**Case in point:** I should have been excited, or at least certainly supportive of a new device that is useful, elegant, and could even have a significant change in the way a specific technology is used. But my reaction (and I suspect a great deal of this page’s readers’ reactions) are more along the lines of a combination of chagrin, envy, and grudging admiration. See how capitalism **ruins *everything***?

Okay, just kidding

But enough about the ranting– what’s the product? Written up in today’s [Times](http://www.nytimes.com) is a little device made by [UTM Systems](http://www.utmsystems.com) that basically acts as an adaptor/card reader to let you insert your credit card into your floppy drive.

And it’s **six bucks**.

Simple. Elegant. Effective. *Cheap*. I think it’s a winner, not just with point-of-sale applications, but imagine that smarmy guy in the expensive suit being able to plug a credit card into his laptop right after he closes a deal in order to book the sale…

Or, for your neo-Luddite relative who doesn’t feel safe typing her card number in at Amazon, simply plug the damned card into the front of her [Gateway](http://www.gateway.com). Of course, [iMacs](http://www.apple.com) need not apply. I wonder how much a USB card reader is?

Speaking of credit cards, is it just me or is it creepy that we Web Weenies have **become a demographic**? Because I find myself very strongly attracted by [American Express’](http://www.americanexpress.com) new Blue card, even without knowing anything about it.

Except that it has a smart chip and a cool design. What a sucker I am.

**Addendum:** Ugh. I went to the UTM Systems website and lost damn near all my enthusiasm for the hardware because the software is so bad. See [fugly interface here](http://www.utmsystems.com/pages/interface.html). Umm, kids, just make it throw the numbers into Explorer or Netscape after you type in your PIN code.

I could reiterate why I hate **faux-brushed metal pseudo-realistic "devices"** as interfaces, but the good folks over at [Isys Information Architects](http://www.iarchitect.com/realcd.htm) have already covered the subject quite eloquently. Didn’t we already learn that these UI’s suck when [Quicktime 4](http://www.iarchitect.com/qtime.htm) came out?
