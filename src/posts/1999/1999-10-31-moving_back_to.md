Well, for me the moving process begins today, as I return to my most favorite city, New York, New York. I’m sure you don’t care too much, but it will affect this page in that the tumultuous state of phone/Internet connections will force updates to be intermittent for the next two weeks or so.

In the meantime, I invite you to visit the [dashes.com homepage](http://www.dashes.com), where the "Froms" menu lists a number of sites which have linked to this one, all of which happen to be excellent, IMHO.

Sadly, due to laziness on my part, the Froms menu only works on IE, so you Netscape users will have to wait another few days until I get that working. **See you soon**…
