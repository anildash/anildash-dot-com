From [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/newsbursts/0,7407,2412804,00.html):

> Microsoft to include Hindi in Win2000
> 
> Microsoft Corp.’s (Nasdaq: MSFT) Windows 2000 software platform, due to be launched in February, will be able to carry programming applications in Hindi and eventually in other Indian languages, company officials said. They told a news conference late on Tuesday that the operating systems software, representing the next version of the company’s NT series of network computing platforms, would be “completely Hindi and Tamil enabled.”

If you consider **how many Indians** are in the software industry, and combine it with the surprisingly large number of PC users *in* India, isn’t it amazing that they only now are releasing a Hindi version of Windows?
