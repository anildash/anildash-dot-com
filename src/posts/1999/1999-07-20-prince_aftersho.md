Actually, it’s technically very early on 21st July, 3:45a to be exact. That bastard [Prince](http://www.prince.org/) made us wait **5 hours** until he showed up. In my opinion, of course, it was worth it. Others who were present tended to disagree…

Also present **onstage at Life** (in the village on Bleecker) were Larry Graham, Rose Stone, and Cynthia & Jerry on the horns (all of **Sly & the Family Stone**) and one of my heroes, [Maceo Parker](http://www.maceo.com/) (of the JB’s and Parliament). Got to shake Jerry Martini’s hand, which was nice. Less notably, Doug E. Fresh and Kool Moe Dee were onstage. In the crowd, we spotted Wyclef, Pras, Jay-Z, Paula Cole, Vernon Reid, and a couple of other people with various levels of celebrity. Highlight for me was hearing “I Wanna Take You Higher” and “**Thank U (Falettin’ Me Be Mice Elf Agin)**” live.
