I was at an industry party tonight (because Internet World is in town) and I heard a PR flack (or is that PR lackey?) describe the site she works for as **"Hotmail for Bookmarks"**.

I don’t know whether to laugh or cry that the ‘net industry has reached the point where the sells are so vapid, generic, and uninspired that they sound like movie pitches.

For the record, dashes.com is "Like *Die Hard* on the *Titanic*…. but as a musical!"
