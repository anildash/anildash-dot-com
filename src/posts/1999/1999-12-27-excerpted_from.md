Excerpted from the [Washington *Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1999-12/26/149l-122699-idx.html):

> “Full-service brokers are not the [Yiddish vulgarism deleted] we’ve been made out to be” is NAIP President Thomas O’Keefe’s plaintive explanation.

The article is about stock brokers complaining that they’ve been **unfairly insulted** and misrepresented in ads by online trading firms. (Etrade, Ameritrade, etc.)

I wish I had read this back in elementary school: "**You’re a Yiddish vulgarism!**"
