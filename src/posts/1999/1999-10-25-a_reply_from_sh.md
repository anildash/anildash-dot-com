**Success!** If you’ll kindly look back to [11 September](091599.html#burger), you’ll see that we had sent a message to Shaun Reilly, proprietor of [ReillyBurger.com](http://www.reillyburger.com) to congratulate him on his culinary achievements. The message we sent was as follows:

> **Mr. Reilly,**

> Upon reading the September 6 Boston Globe article detailing your prodigious accomplishments in the advanced study of caloric intake, we felt compelled to drop you a note of hearty congratulations.

> We think it is fitting that the millennium has now concluded by coming full circle to its roots of pure, unrelenting gluttony. What you have endured gastronomically is nothing short of a beacon of hope for such would-be kings as ourselves.

> Alas, fear is indeed a powerful deterrent.

> The chances (real or imagined) of stomach rupture, heart attack, completely kidney failure and the like, have long since bound us to the minor-leagues of eating. The utter and profound lack of disregard for your body is truly inspiring, a rare plateau of excellence that was showcased by the 8 pounds of food which you so humbly and dutifully consumed in that deli.

> With the exceptions of World War 2 and the birth of Christ, we hold this achievement as the single most important historical event of the last 2,000 years. Thank you for what you have given us, O great upholder of Bacchanalian ideals.

> Jon Markle & Anil Dash

Now, my friend Jon had basically drafted the whole letter, but I was very pleased with it, and chagrined that we didn’t recieve a response… **until now**!

**Here’s what he said:**

> Dear Mr. Markle and Mr. Dash,

> I would first like to apologize for taking so long to reply to you very kind a articulate E-Mail. Things have been quite hectic with all the
> 
> publicity that has come from this event.

> I would totally concur with all of your statements in your letter and
> 
> appreciate you recognizing the true magnitude of this historical event.
> 
> You are both true visionaries that will be very fortuitous in your
> 
> futures.

> I urge you to tell others of this and to keep the dream alive of being able to consume 8-10lbs. of greasy food in one sitting. It is a lost art
> 
> and one that I feel should be rediscovered.

> Please feel free to write to me and to let me know any progress you have made or any help you may need.

> Also please feel free to check out my website at [www.reillyburger.com](http://www.reillyburger.com) to
> 
> see some more information on this. The site is far form complete but
> 
> there is nice working template for all those interested.

> Again thank you for your kind words,

> **Shaun Reilly**
