The first hazy outlines of a weblog are born here, expect entries to be added both forwards and backwards from here.

**Until the content’s in place**, just satisfy yourself by clicking around some of my favorite links, **up at the top**, or [email me](mailto:anil@dashes.com), or poke around my full set of [bookmarks](http://www.dashes.com/anil/bookmark/).

Also, one of the primary inspirations for this site is [PeterMe](http://www.peterme.com), which may also constitute a virtual self-weblog for me, in that **Peter Merholz** is also an ENTP, info-space designing GSSM… ah, curious fate. I suppose these sorts of descriptions can replace “What’s your sign?” from now on…
