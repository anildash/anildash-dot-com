**Everything that rises must converge.** If pressed to recite a short list of some of my favorite pop musicians, that list would undoubtedly include [Prince](http://www.prince.org), [Ani DiFranco](http://www.anidifranco.net), and Chuck D of [Public Enemy](http://www.publicenemy.com). Interesting to me, then, that all *three* are now free of standard recording contracts and will appear on [one album](http://www.love4oneanother.com/rave) together.

For a geek like me, itâ€™s an early Christmas.
