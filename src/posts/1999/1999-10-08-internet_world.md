So I was at **Internet World** today, which isn’t really my cup of tea. Except that I love **free kitsch**, and what better way to collect than at a trade show?

The disappointing things? Well, that there was only **one human-factors-related company** in the *entire* show. Boggles my mind. And can we all get over the infatuation with booth babes? Are techie guys really that pathetic? It makes me sad.

And why will grown people apparently do *anything* for a free t-shirt? "Oooh! Oooh! MEEE! Pick MEEEE to wear advertising for your company!".

Watch this space for a rant on the subject later, but let me simply say that if Tiger Woods is worth $40 million for wearing a logo on his clothes, (and I’m not saying he’s not…) then I can certainly be paid a few token dollars to wear some company’s advertising.

Of course, it’s hard to be **absolutely pure** about these things. I wear logos on clothing if it’s from one of my clients, as I figure they *are* paying me. And I have a few items I’ve recieved as gifts. And I needed a pair of sneakers on short notice (after having not worn sneakers for 4 or 5 years) and ended up with a pair that have the name/logo of the manufacturer on the back of them, much to my dismay.

Anyone want a t-shirt with my name on it?
