Just got back from [CamCon](http://www.camworld.com/party/), (a.k.a. the Camvention) where I had the good fortune to meet the nice people behind (to name but a few) [Monstro.com](http://www.monstro.com), [MemePool](http://www.memepool.com), [Calamondin](http://www.calamondin.com), [lexiconoclast](http://www.lexiconoclast.com), [peterme.com](http://www.peterme.com), [Mr. Barrett](http://www.mrbarrett.com), and, of course, [Camworld](http://www.camworld.com).

A fun bunch, much mirth was had, and more observations to come later. Surprising how well everyone **looked like their blogs** indicated they would, no big surprises. I forgot my digital camera, but I’m sure some of the other nice folks remembered theirs, so you’ll see the photos then. Especially of [*someone*‘s](http://www.peterme.com) newly-purple hair.
