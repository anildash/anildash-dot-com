In advance of the upcoming release of *The Last Jedi*, excitement is building for all things Star Wars, so I’m thrilled to share that I got to be a guest on the inestimable Star Wars Minute podcast. The show tackles the world’s most popular franchise one movie at a time, one *minute* at a time, and I was lucky enough to get to comment on everybody’s second-to-least-favorite Star Wars movie, *Attack of the Clones*.

It was really a joy to be on Star Wars Minute, and every one of these short conversations was amusing the whole way through — please do give them a listen!
