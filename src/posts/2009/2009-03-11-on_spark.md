Those of you who liked my [post the other day](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/02/you-didnt-miss-anything.html) about not missing anything while I was offline might also enjoy [a conversation](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2009/02/how-much-information-overload-is-self-induced/) I had with CBC Radio’s show [Spark](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2009/03/episode-69-march-11-14-2009/), part of which will be on the air today. Canadians can hear it on CBC Radio One at 11:30 a.m. or on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. Sirius subscribers can find showtimes on the site, and geeks can [listen to Spark right now](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2009/03/episode-69-march-11-14-2009/) on the CBC’s site. (My clip starts at about 15:20.)

(There’s also a little nod to the post [over on Deadspin](http://deadspin.com/5166953/the-internet-makes-death-come-quicker-and-easier) — check out the comments, where smart boys discover that “Anil” looks like “anal”!)
