About seven years ago, Matt Haughey, Paul Bausch and Meg Hourihan ran a very cool early blogging community called Blogroots, which acted as watercooler for conversations about the evolution of the then-nascent medium.

I’d found some links to the site in the Web Archive a few months ago, and sent them around, and then was delighted to see one of them surface on its own again today. Gawker Media’s Erin Pettigrew used [the initial thread about the launch of Gizmodo](http://web.archive.org/web/20021002042104/www.blogroots.com/comments.blog/129) (Gawker’s first title), along with [my post at the time](http://dashes.com/anil/2002/08/gizmodo-launche.html) as a jumping-off point for [a look at Gawker’s success seven years later](http://advertising.gawker.com/5351013/then-and-now-seven-years-of-blogging-as-business). I’m a big fan of using the history of our blogs as a record of the lessons we’ve learned over the years, and I’m glad I wasn’t (overly) harsh about Gawker’s chances.

As far as advertising on blogs goes, though, I’ll admit I’ve become a bit of a convert to the potential. Today’s conversation prompted a quick glance at the numbers for the biggest blog advertising platforms in the U.S., revealing something kind of interesting:

Not too shabby, considering it’s only been a little over a year since [Six Apart Media](http://www.sixapart.com/advertising) launched. Another little trivia note — that first Gizmodo design, which inspired such an interesting conversation, was designed and implemented by Mena and Ben Trott, working as sort of an ancient ancestor of today’s [Six Apart Services](http://www.sixapart.com/services/). It’s fun to see that everybody involved is not only still blogging, but succeeding at it.
