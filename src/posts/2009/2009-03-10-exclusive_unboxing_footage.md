I have to admit, I was a little bit gobsmacked when I saw that our little nerd world is becoming so mainstream that [Jimmy Fallon had a gadget blogger featured on his show](https://web.archive.org/web/20090522013432/http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/blogs/2009/03/get-a-look-at-the-palm-pre/) the other night — and it wasn’t even for an iPhone launch! Now, I believe Mr. Fallon is genuinely a geek (and I *know* Questlove is), but it still seems a little bit… off.

And I realized that part of the issue is that I’m not sure gadget blogs are the best representative of the world of true geekery. However, I realize this might be my own hubris, so I decided that if I can’t beat ’em, I’ll join ’em. Here, then, is my first-ever attempt at creating EXCLUSIVE UNBOXING FOOTAGE for the gadgetosphere: The [Advair inhaler](http://www.advair.com/)!

I’ll update with an Amazon affiliate link where you buy this product as soon as GlaxoSmithKlein lifts the embargo. I didn’t list a price here, because obviously the cost depends on the subsidies with your plan, but under my plan the street price was right around $25.

(Special thanks to [Alaina Browne](http://www.alaina.org/) for the expert camera work.)
