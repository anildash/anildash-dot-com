I’ve been a fan of The KLF since I was a teenager, and just last week was reminded of one of their most amazing stunts. This is just the first of a five-part video showing the entire “[Burn a Million Quid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Foundation_Burn_a_Million_Quid)” documentary, and I think you don’t get to see the actual torching until part two, but it’s well worth the look.

What’s interesting to me is how many people respond to this performance by saying it made them feel sick to their stomachs. I am not quite sure what that signifies.
