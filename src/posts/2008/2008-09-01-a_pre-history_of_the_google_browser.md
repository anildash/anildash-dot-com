Today, in a surprisingly botched announcement, Google announced Chrome, their upcoming open source web browser. The subject of a Google browser is something I’ve [opined on](http://dashes.com/anil/2003/07/upon-the-demise.html) a few times over the years, but Jason Kottke’s compiled [an even more comprehensive](http://www.kottke.org/08/09/google-chrome-google-browser) overview of the conversations a few of us have been having for almost seven years.

If that’s up your alley, you might want to check out:

- [Stories and Tools](http://dashes.com/anil/2002/04/stories-and-too.html), which at six years old is a little dated, but offered up some thoughts on the presentation of web applications that I thought connected nicely with the [Google Chrome comic book](http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/).
- [Google and Theory of Mind](http://dashes.com/anil/2007/12/google-and-theory-of-mind.html), about Google’s great weakness in the insularity of the company’s culture.
- [Google Web History – Good and Scary](http://dashes.com/anil/2007/04/google-web-hist.html), which at the launch of Google’s Web History feature examined some of the implications of the new tracking system.
- [The Circle of (Web) Life](http://dashes.com/anil/2007/01/its-the-circle.html), which described a cycle of web businesses supporting each other, based on Google’s support for Mozilla.
- [How Matt Haughey Beat Google](http://dashes.com/anil/2006/12/matt-haughey-beat-google.html), challenging the inevitability of Google’s domination of markets by pointing out how they weren’t able to compete with a self-funded, passionate person and his community.
- [Google Office: Google Apps for Your Domain](http://dashes.com/anil/2006/08/google-office-g.html), which put the launch of Google Apps in the context of both the office suite competition and Google’s other offerings.
- [The Microcontent Client](http://dashes.com/anil/2002/11/introducing-microcontent-client.html), an outline of ideas about the evolution of browsers and information management applications from 2002.
- Finally, [Google’s First Mistake](http://dashes.com/anil/2003/02/googles-first-m.html), my rumination on Google’s acquisition of Pyra Labs, a post whose accuracy has both increased and decreased in the years since I wrote it.
