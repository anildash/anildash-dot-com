Today, in a surprisingly botched announcement, Google announced Chrome, their upcoming open source web browser. The subject of a Google browser is something I’ve [opined on](/2003/07/upon-the-demise) a few times over the years, but Jason Kottke’s compiled [an even more comprehensive](http://www.kottke.org/08/09/google-chrome-google-browser) overview of the conversations a few of us have been having for almost seven years.

If that’s up your alley, you might want to check out:

- [Stories and Tools](/2002/04/stories-and-too), which at six years old is a little dated, but offered up some thoughts on the presentation of web applications that I thought connected nicely with the [Google Chrome comic book](http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/).
- [Google and Theory of Mind](/2007/12/google-and-theory-of-mind), about Google’s great weakness in the insularity of the company’s culture.
- [Google Web History – Good and Scary](/2007/04/google-web-hist), which at the launch of Google’s Web History feature examined some of the implications of the new tracking system.
- [The Circle of (Web) Life](/2007/01/its-the-circle), which described a cycle of web businesses supporting each other, based on Google’s support for Mozilla.
- [How Matt Haughey Beat Google](/2006/12/matt-haughey-beat-google), challenging the inevitability of Google’s domination of markets by pointing out how they weren’t able to compete with a self-funded, passionate person and his community.
- [Google Office: Google Apps for Your Domain](/2006/08/google-office-g), which put the launch of Google Apps in the context of both the office suite competition and Google’s other offerings.
- [The Microcontent Client](/2002/11/introducing-microcontent-client), an outline of ideas about the evolution of browsers and information management applications from 2002.
- Finally, [Google’s First Mistake](/2003/02/googles-first-m), my rumination on Google’s acquisition of Pyra Labs, a post whose accuracy has both increased and decreased in the years since I wrote it.
