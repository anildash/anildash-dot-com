As always, I am trying to be everywhere at once. Here’s where I’ve succeeded:

- Dan Costa at PC Magazine offers a [look at the rise of micro social networks](https://books.google.com/books?id=_hGsvsL4vVwC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=pc+magazine+%22The+Micro+Threat+to+Facebook%22&source=bl&ots=GYjsGmDLFU&sig=ACfU3U0r5TFtZBfwzL4LWkWVUdEnzSqFmA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjEsLjU59H8AhWyElkFHS8tDbUQ6AF6BAgIEAM#v=onepage&q&f=false). I get a nod there, but it’s more satisfying to see the idea itself take off. That’s an idea that [Chris](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915220817/http://www.r21.org/) and I revisited at the [BlogWorld](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029074945/http://www.blogworldexpo.com/) conference last week, along with a discussion of [blogging becoming an industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002024906/http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/09/29/blogworld-blogging-becoming-an-industry/).
- There’s a pleasantly inexplicable [passing mention of me](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216042101/http://blog.internetnews.com/kcorbin/2008/09/silicon-alley-no-more.html) in reference to the Web 2.0 Expo here in New York. In case it’s not been clear in the past, I am *delighted* that the tech industry in NYC is closely linked to other industries like media and finance. It gives us a useful perspective and makes tech companies in NYC wiser and less prone to falling into the echo chamber that frustrates me about a lot of Silicon Valley companies. And I never liked the name “Silicon Alley” anyway.
- The South Asian Journalists Association invited me to participate in the [first of two conversations about the South Asian blogging community](https://web.archive.org/web/20081219070538/http://www.sajaforum.org/2008/09/webcast-the-sou.html). I thought a lot of the points raised were pretty interesteing, and am a big fan of the [SAJA blog](http://www.sajaforum.org/), so this was a lot of fun.
- The less said about [this](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/09/anil-dash-remixes-the-freeconferencecallcom-hold-music.html), the better. I’m looking at you, [Andy](http://www.buzzfeed.com/yacomink/hold-music-remix-v).
