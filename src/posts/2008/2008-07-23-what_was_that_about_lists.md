I forgot to mention one point when I was [blathering about lists](/2008/07/lists-and-being-on-them) earlier this week: The easiest way to get on them is by asserting, truthfully or not, that you don’t want to be on them.

Behold, my [incredible mancrushworthiness](https://web.archive.org/web/20080906185424/http://www.urlesque.com:80/2008/07/23/blogger-mancrush-anil-dash/), from an [entire list](https://web.archive.org/web/20080728155207/http://www.urlesque.com:80/2008/07/23/20-bloggers-on-whom-were-mancrushin/) of the mancrush-worthy. Or something.

It’s nice to be called nice, but it’s even better that people wrongly believe that I *am* nice. Thanks, Eliot!
