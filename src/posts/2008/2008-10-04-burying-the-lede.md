I think one of the biggest reasons many great writers go into journalism is for the chance to sneak little wisecracks in, with the hope their editors will indulge. I took the opportunity to read a *printed copy* of the New York Times the other day, and spotted a gem in [this local story on Michael Bloomberg striving for a third term](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/nyregion/01support.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink) as mayor of New York City:

> Mr. Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader who founded Bloomberg L.P., a financial information firm, was sought out by the press as a financial guru. He appeared on “Meet the Press” and was not shy about commenting during public events about his interactions with the central players in the financial drama, whether it was Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. (Mr. Bloomberg calls him Hank) or Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman’s chairman and chief executive (Dick, of course).

Hank! Dick!
