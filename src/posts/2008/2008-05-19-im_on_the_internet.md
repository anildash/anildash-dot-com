Because my name and my big ole’ head are sitting on top of this page, it’s probably not making the self-indulgence any worse to collect a few links to some recent places I’ve popped up online:

- [Gawker recommended](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122193752/http://gawker.com/391246/your-twitter+stalking-power-list)[my Twitter account](http://twitter.com/anildash) as one to follow after [Krucoff posted a list to Young Manhattanite](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006111003/http://youngmanhattanite.com/2008/05/dont-shoot-canary.html) based on [Rex](http://fimoculous.com/)‘s suggestions. The strange thing to me is that Gawker is (still!) such a presence in media circles in NYC that 6,000 people would actually *read* such a thing. Of course, they’re all just wannabees — real Gawker credit comes from having been [at the launch party](https://web.archive.org/web/20080605030524/http://gawker.com/news/chris-anderson/shades-of-launch-party-chris-anderson-and-anil-dash-11224.php) five years ago. I’m just sayin’. (For more, similarly inane insights, [add me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/anildash)!)
- I helped [Charlene Li](https://web.archive.org/web/20080622093858/http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/) (a.k.a. The Best Tech Industry Analyst) [save $8.33](https://web.archive.org/web/20080622114746/http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2008/03/how-i-made-833.html) by [offering up my testimonial about the Clear card](/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-clear-card). That’s enough to pay for a subscription to dashes.com for more than a year!
- [Mat Honan wrote a piece in Wired](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/magazine/16-05/st_alpha) about [The Big Word Project](http://thebigwordproject.com/), the scam website where people pay for words. My site shows up because it’s the link for the word “[purple](https://web.archive.org/web/20080616022740/http://www.thebigwordproject.com/search?word=purple)“, even though I didn’t do it myself. I blame Mike.
- CRN has a (really very good) [look at what the technology industry wants from the Presidential candidates](https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173253/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/207400714;jsessionid=EX21SA455BICUQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=1), with responses from the likes of Bill Gates and Paul Otellini. Inexplicably, [I’m in there, too](https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173258/http://www.crn.com/it-channel/207400714;jsessionid=GGUUKCVWKQOVOQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?pgno=11): “The No. 1 thing we want to see is elected officials use social networking tools online as a tool for governance and for leadership when in office, just as they do to get elected.” Basically, I am tired of politicians treating web communities as an ATM for their campaigns, instead of seeing the web as an opportunity for fixing government.
- And last but certainly not least, “[So What Do You Do, Anil Dash](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906134820/http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/details.asp?aID=10184&)“. It’s a really long interview with me by the folks at Mediabistro, in advance of my presentation at the [Mediabistro Circus](http://www.mediabistrocircus.com/) event on Tuesday. If you know me, there’s probably few surprises, but I was happy to get the chance to articulate a lot of points that I otherwise don’t usually talk about explicitly. Most of all, I am really glad to help emphasize how vibrant the technology scene is here in New York City; My biggest goal in participating in these sorts of conferences here in New York is to show people that there’s a lot more going on with tech here than people might realize if they’re myopically focused on just Silicon Valley.
