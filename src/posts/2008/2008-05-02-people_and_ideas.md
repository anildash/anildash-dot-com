These are the things I saw yesterday that I thought were interesting, entertaining, and inspiring. First, [Erika Hall](http://muledesign.com/), [Copy as Interface](http://www.slideshare.net/mulegirl/copy-as-interface). (See more on [the Mule blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20090201085834/http://weblog.muledesign.com/2008/04/copy_as_interface_deck_now_ava.php).)

[Mena Trott](http://www.dollarshort.org/), [Wasted on the Young](https://web.archive.org/web/20080521031700/http://www.dollarshort.org/ds/2008/04/wasted-on-the-young.html).  
  
[Cheryl Coward](https://afterellen.com/web-pioneer-lynne-d-johnson/), on AfterEllen, profiling Lynne d. Johnson. (See more on [Lynne’s blog](http://www.lynnedjohnson.com/diary/the_real_rock_stars_of_black_blogs/).)

> “When I think about black females on the web with technology, Lynne [d. Johnson]’s name easily comes to mind,” said Karsh, founder of the Black Weblog Awards and blackgayblogger.com. “She has masterfully been able to understand and bridge the gap between online and print media in a major way, from her work with Vibe magazine to her current work at FastCompany.”

Aaand that’s all for now.
