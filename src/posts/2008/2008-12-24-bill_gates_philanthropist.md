In the middle of this year, in observation of his retirement from Microsoft, I wrote [Bill Gates and the Greatest Tech Hack Ever](/2008/06/bill-gates-and-the-greatest-tech-hack-ever), one of my most popular posts and one that I’ve had a number of people personally mention to me that they appreciated.

So, I was delighted to see [Dale Doughtery’s appreciation of Bill Gates](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/admiring-bill-gates.html). Dale’s my favorite blogger on O’Reilly’s popular Radar blog, and this post shows why: A keen focus on the implications and sustainability of our choices in the tech industry.

> In many ways, Gates represents the “best of us” — it’s not just what he’s doing but how he thinks about what he’s doing. He’s a curious geek. He wants to find interesting problems to solve. He believes that smart, self-motivated people working together can make a difference. Bill Gates reflects the best qualities of a generation that has grown up finding the innovative ways to apply science and technology to impact our everyday life in mostly positive ways.

Even better, as pointed out by [my friend and coworker Michael Sippey](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/12/dale-dougherty-on-bill-gates.html), one of [my heroes](/2004/05/the-day-i-met-d), [Dan Bricklin](http://danbricklin.com/log/), showed up and [weighed in on the post](https://web.archive.org/web/20090125224410/http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/12/admiring-bill-gates.html#comment-2049548) as well.
