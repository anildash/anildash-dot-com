> I started blogging when I was 25, and it was a much smaller blogosphere back in 2000. I was able to make my mistakes in oversharing, overexposure, and unmitigated egotism in a smaller pond, without the entire New York media world and Jimmy Kimmel staring at me. In some ways, blogging and I grew up together, so by the time I was doing national television, I’d already had lots of media training … a luxury Emily Gould didn’t seem to have. I also developed some personal boundaries before I had thousands of daily readers, a luxury Emily Gould also didn’t have.
