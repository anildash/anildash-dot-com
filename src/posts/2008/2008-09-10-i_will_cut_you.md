Last Friday was my birthday. Hooray! I have a fantastic wife, so she treated me to a [pig-butchering class](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915045306/http://www.thebrooklynkitchen.com/web-store/classes/1041-916-tuesday-pig-butchering-class/) at [The Brooklyn Kitchen](http://www.thebrooklynkitchen.com/). I like meat, and I like being educated about what I eat and respecting the animals I consume. So [Tom Mylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mylan) was a fantastic person to lead the evening: Knowledgeable and passionate about his work as a butcher, and (as his blog demonstrates well) able to articulate that in a way that’s approachable even to rank amateurs like me.

Even better, my wife [posted a great writeup](https://web.archive.org/web/20080914005523/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/09/pig-butchering-class-at-the-brooklyn-kitchen-williamsburg-tom-mylan-pork-nyc.html) over on Serious Eats. There’s lots more info on other Brooklyn Kitchen classes and on Tom there. And as I’ve [mentioned before](/2005/04/being-an-expert), I love displays of true competence, especially in regard to knives. And Tom has a [stellar post about choosing knives](http://groceryguy.blogspot.com/2008/07/answers-knife.html) which shows off exactly that kind of expertise.

There’s a lot of cuts of meat in a pig, as the diagram here shows. (That’s courtesy of the [Wikipedia page on pork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork).) And if you, like me, want to see more examples of the process of breaking down a sizable animal, [Adam Fields has a full photo set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/fields/sets/72157604254578730/), and [The Brooklyn Kitchen’s Flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/95231779@N00/2422004296/) has a photo set on the making of head cheese. Both of those photo albums are probably not for those squeamish about butchering.

- [Ask The Meatman](http://www.askthemeatman.com/hog_cuts_interactive_chart.htm) offers an Interactive Pork Chart.
- [Ben Trott went whole-hog](http://ben.stupidfool.org/typepad/2008/06/for-the-love-of-pork.html) as well.
- [Chris Cosentino](https://web.archive.org/web/20080912210824/http://www.gourmet.com/food/video/2008/09/cosentino_pigshead) butchers a pig’s head — with video!

I could ramble on about this forever, but we have about 15 pounds of fresh pork in the kitchen now, so there’s work to be done.
