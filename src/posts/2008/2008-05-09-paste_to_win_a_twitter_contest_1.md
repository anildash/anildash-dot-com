If you haven’t been following [my Twitter account](http://twitter.com/anildash), you’re missing all the fun! In between [going aggro on teakettles](http://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/806678829), taking an unseemly joy in [crude wordplay](http://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/799137112), and in general trying to channel my incessant nattering into an [attempt at being entertaining](https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081243/http://favotter.matope.com/en/user.php?user=anildash&mode=best). But now I’ve tried to do something a little bit different, starting a [little Twitter contest](http://twitter.com/anildash/statuses/805608769) with some simple rules of entry:

> Okay, everybody, it’s Ctrl-V time! Paste into Twitter whatever text you copied last, and @anildash me. Best paste gets a prize.

Amazingly, I got **160 responses** from over 150 different people, and I’ve assembled the results into a few categories here for your enjoyment. I removed the date stamps and other clutter from the responses, and formatted the (many!) links into readable formats with some very brief descriptions appended. The categories I’ve grouped them into include [mundane](#mundane), [passwords](#passwords), [links](#links), [links with text](#linkstext), [actually working](#actually), [nerds and coders](#nerds), [explainers](#explainers), [jokers](#jokers), [WTF](#WTF), and [pleasant](#pleasing). And then, finally, from all these submissions, I name our [winner](#winner), along with the surprise prize. Enjoy, and please feel free to mention your favorites in the comments.

## Mundane

These were, of course, the perfunctory entries in the contest, people who had the misfortune to have been doing something simple and ordinary when the contest launched. They’re all exciting, talented individuals, but just had bad luck at the time with what was on the ole’ clipboard.

## Passwords

I don’t have any proof that all of these random strings are *actually* people’s passwords, but I’d like to think we can hack all their accounts with this information.

## Links

Ah, the bread and butter of Twitter. A surprising number of wacky or topical news stories, along with the detritus of people passing along links to their friends. Almost all of these were originally TinyURLs; I rewrote them with brief summaries for convenience, but may have sacrificed some accuracy in the process.

## Links + Text

Same thing as the links, but these folks had something to say about their links.

## Actually Working

The brief snippets that showed up from a few folks indicated they were *actually in the middle of doing productive work* when the contest began. I take no small satisfaction in having interrupted their productivity.

- [Bash](http://twitter.com/Bash) photography? scheduled for 19 May 2008

## Nerds and Coders

Some of these could easily have fallen under the [Actually Working](#actually) category, but I know a lot of geeks, and that manifests itself as a lot of code, errors, system messages and the like showing up in people’s copy-and-paste tweets.

## Explainers

These folks were unsure about what they sent along, so they had follow-up tweets to offer context.

- [asimaythink](http://twitter.com/asimaythink) “Portishead veröffentlichen nach 14 Jahren ihr erstes gutes Album”
- [asimaythink](http://twitter.com/asimaythink) Which translates to “Portishead finally release their first good album after 14 years”.

- [dunq](http://twitter.com/dunq) I hope I don’t win with that one.

## Jokers

I suspect that not all of these were the *actual* content that would have been pasted into Twitter without some editing taking place. But I don’t mind so much.

## Pleasant

## Winner!

And finally, ladies and gentlemen, our winner, [Jessamyn West](http://librarian.net/)! Her WTF entry was:

> [jessamyn](http://twitter.com/jessamyn/statuses/805645421n) Personally, I’m after the uncontrolled growth of pubic hair. Great hedge rows, barely contained by trousers. I try to get onto th

Jessamyn offers up, [after an apology to the rest of her followers](http://twitter.com/jessamyn/statuses/805645914), that the full quote she had copied was from a mailing list that she belongs to, and reads in its entirety: “Personally, I’m after the uncontrolled growth of pubic hair. Great hedge rows, barely contained by trousers. I try to get onto the N-Judah one day and my furry rose bush of a hair bloom parts the crowd, greeted by great choruses of outrage.”

It’s a striking, vivid, and moving image. And one that’s well-deserving of an award, in the eyes of this judge.

In Jessamyn’s honor, thanks to [Donors Choose](http://www.donorschoose.org/), we’ve funded [Whoooo, Whooo Ate What?](https://web.archive.org/web/20100527054644/http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=182646) This will provide 15 owl pellets for dissection by a group of kids in 4th grade . Let’s just not tell them what the winning quote in our little contest was, shall we? No need to scar them for life.
