One of the things that makes [Snoop’s “Sensual Seduction” video](/2008/02/snoop-dogg-can-see-the-future) so compelling is his outstanding use of vocal effects. Let’s take a closer look, shall we?

In the video, Snoop makes liberal use of a breath tube on his keytar, an obvious homage to the talkbox made (in)famous by [Roger Troutman](https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/california-loved/Content?oid=2145601) of Zapp fame. (If you don’t know and love the funk, then you at least know Roger from the hook to Tupac’s “California Love”.) Snoop even [even explicitly credits Troutman](https://web.archive.org/web/20080205141144/http://suckerfreeblog.mtv.com/2007/12/03/snoop-dogg-on-his-sensual-seduction-throwback-video/) in an MTV interview, along with the much-more-obvious nods in the video to Prince and Rick James.

The thing is, “Sensual Seduction” *doesn’t* use the [talkbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_box), nor does it use a vocoder, which is a completely different instrument that often gets credit for the talkbox’s outbut. The vocoder is an amazing instrument; There’s an [interesting background](https://web.archive.org/web/20071027172007/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/vocoder/index.html) on the technology in this [survey of milestones in electronic musical instruments](https://web.archive.org/web/20071023070533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/), and the good folks at O’Reilly will even [tell you how to make your own](https://web.archive.org/web/20060707135121/http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/03/29/vocoder-tutorial-and-tips.html), if you’re so inclined. I’ve been hoping for the vocoder and talkbox to return to the top of the pop charts for a solid decade now (ever since “California Love”, really) and am somewhat chagrined that so much of the recent voice-distortion on pop singles is in the context of rather uninspired songs. But I digress.

Music today isn’t made by connecting breathing tubes to home-built contraptions. Instead, commercial music is made in Digidesign’s [ProTools](https://web.archive.org/web/20080215211527/http://www.digidesign.com/index.cfm?langid=100&navid=234&itemid=28112&ref=74-f). ProTools is to commercial audio what Photoshop is to commercial design: Platform, product, and verb. And the first, and signature tool for performing pitch-correction on ProTools was Antares’ [Auto-Tune](http://www.antarestech.com/products/auto-tune5.shtml). The fun part is, now that we’ve entered this brave new world of digital distortion of vocals, Auto-Tune isn’t just *correcting* pitch, it’s being used to arbitrarily alter them.

You know the rest. Cher’s “Believe”? Auto-Tune. Snoop’s “Sensual Seduction”? Auto-Tune. And *all of [T-Pain](https://tpain.com)‘s career*? Auto-Tune. Now, it’s possible that some producers are using other software to perform similar pitch-correction/pitch-manipulation duties; There are even [free clones](http://www.gvst.co.uk/gsnap.htm) of Auto-Tune’s functionality. But as often as not, the software that’s become synonymous with the effect is the one that’s responsible for the sound.

And so, another bit of analog sound-hacking makes way for its digital successor. Even if he’s using the latest software, I gotta give props to Snoop for honoring the low-tech inspiration.

- Naturally, [“Sensual Seduction” is available](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0012C0G2C/2020-2) as an MP3 on Amazon.com
- You can also [buy “California Love”](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ZMUV2K/2020-2) over on Amazon, too. No iTunes links because DRM is wack.

I’ve written [a lot more](/tags/autotune/) about Auto-Tune: Check out [When Auto-Tune Strikes](/2008/02/when-autotune-strikes), about the fact that T-Pain can’t sing, and [Last of the Auto-Tune](/2008/02/last-of-the-autotune), which [Gawker hailed](https://web.archive.org/web/20080215115117/http://gawker.com/356223/the-ultimate-analysis-of-snoops-sensual-seduction) as the “ultimate analysis” of this phenomenon.
