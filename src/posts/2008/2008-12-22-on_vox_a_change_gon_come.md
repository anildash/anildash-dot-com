Thanks to a [nice reminder](https://web.archive.org/web/20090103044029/http://twitter.com/miz_ginevra/status/1073658911) from [Ginevra](http://ginevra.vox.com/), and a motivational [post by Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2008/12/the-color-of-change/6486/), I got around to gathering up some videos I've been meaning to share. Obviously, Barack Obama's made some fairly explicit references to Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come", so I should share a few pleasing renditions of the song with you.

Seal turns in a fairly rote, but still worth-the-listen version of the old chestnut. There's something about Seal's voice that makes me wish he had a little bit more Terence Trent D'Arby in him when he sings soul songs. From surprisingly short of soul we switch rapidly to surprisingly soulful, with Wayne Brady's (yes, Wayne Brady's) competent version of "Change"

Not bad, Wayne! A sudden contender for Best Recent Cover of the song comes in the form of Anthony Hamilton, whose version I actually hadn't ever heard before Coates linked to it.

And then, for my money, the best recent (albeit using "recent" as a relative term, since it's 14 years old at this point) cover of "A Change Is Gonna Come" is by the wildly underrated R&B group (and [Jam & Lewis](/2006/07/culture-jamming) project) Solo:

Solo had such pure soulful voices that they were able to make even material as regrettably titled as "Where Do You Want Me To Put It?" seem charming and fun. Well worth the listen, and it stands up well even today.

And since I mentioned Sam Cooke, please see Prince, Kristin Scott-Thomas and Jerome Benton:

Where would you go?
