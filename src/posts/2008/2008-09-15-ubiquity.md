Right now I am here, but soon I may be somewhere near you! Let’s see where I’ve been lately, and where I’m going to be:

Across the internets, [Choire asked a ridiculous question of mine](https://web.archive.org/web/20090105172511/http://www.choiresicha.com/interviews/oh_man_i_just_realized.html) to [Wendy and Lisa](http://www.wendyandlisa.com/) when he [interviewed them for the LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-ca-conversation3-2008aug03,0,852211.story). [Michaelangelo picked this up](http://idolator.com/399934/did-wendy--lisa-kickstart-pop+cultural-lesbian-chic) on Idolator, and I think my work is done here.

Absurdly, an [offhand comment about Rudy Giuliani](https://web.archive.org/web/20090218222727/http://www.playboy.com/blog/2008/09/st-paul-the-belly-of-the-barracuda.html), the *former Mayor of New York City* who likes to mock people for being “too cosmopolitan”, got quoted on the Playboy blog. Did you know Playboy has a blog?

And my presentation from the [Mediabistro Circus](https://web.archive.org/web/20090123194043/http://www.mediabistro.com/circus/) back in May is [now available on video](https://web.archive.org/web/20120610113359/http://www.mediabistro.com/blogging-53-ondemandvideo.html), confirming once again that it’s incredibly painful to watch oneself on video.

I’m also looking forward to a bunch of upcoming events.

- I’m proud to have helped out a little bit with [Web 2.0 Expo New York](http://en.oreilly.com/webexny2008/public/content/home). Frankly, we have an amazing tech scene here in NYC ([Six Apart is hiring!](http://www.sixapart.com/jobs)) and we haven’t done enough to get recognition for it from the tech world at large. That’s why I’m quoted on the Expo site saying, “Well, it’s about  time.” Heh.
- Next weekend in Las Vegas, I’ll be joining Chris Alden, our CEO at Six Apart, in a keynote presentation at [Blog World Expo](https://web.archive.org/web/20080430133248/http://www.blogworldexpo.com/). If you’ll be there Saturday morning, come see us, or find me at the event before or after.
- Finally, next month, I’ll be in Greensboro, North Carolina for [ConvergeSouth](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217020728/http://2008.convergesouth.com/). I am sure there will be many interesting things to do and see there, but my first priority is to get some barbeque. I’m sure y’all understand.
