Some extraordinarily kind and generous soul sent me [The Encyclopedia of New York City](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0300055366/2020-20) from my Amazon wishlist for my birthday tomorrow, but neglected to identify themselves on the note in the package. It’s a truly fantastic gift, so if you sent it, please let me know so I can properly thank you.

To the rest of you, I’d strongly recommend the book. Obviously, as a 1300+ page reference book, it’s not exactly light reading, but it’s still well worth keeping around if you’re a fan of the city.
