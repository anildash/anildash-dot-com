It’s been about 10 years, where’s the Best of Method Man collection? You could fill a strong 2-disc set or one bangin’ solid CD of tunes with Meth’s tracks, even without getting into all his duets, guest appearances, and wu-tang stuff. It’s damned near impossible to grab all his stuff from soundtracks and collections unless you’re a diehard, and he’s got more charisma than any working rapper today (with the possible exception of Busta Rhymes or Snoop) so it would be well worth revisiting his career.

Don’t make me have to download all the MP3s and burn it myself, dammit.
