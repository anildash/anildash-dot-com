I have all these high-concept ideas for sites that I never get around to building. One of them was going to be an anonymous parody of myself, a big purple blog with a bunch of posts about arcane details about New York City, some weblog triumphalism, and a sidebar of links all promoting Six Apart products. Maybe bonus points for any subtle references to really bad pop albums. But, frankly, Iâ€™m too lazy. If I just throw the idea out there, can we consider it having been implemented and just have a good laugh together?
