Just as an experiment today, I’ll be taking submissions for links to go up on the Daily Links sidebar. You can [email them](mailto:anil@dashes.com?subject=Daily%20Links) to me, but there’s a few rules. No self-links, it has to be something interesting that most people haven’t seen, and it can’t be something that I’ve posted before. (Though, given that my search doesn’t really work for the Daily Links, I’ll be forgiving if you send me a repost.)

Oh, and no whining if your link doesn’t get picked. Let’s see what you’ve got.

**Update:** I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. I put up a request for links and actually got fewer submissions than I get on a normal day. Though I will say that the quality of the submissions went up as people who don’t usually contribute took the time to email, even if I didn’t use their links. Thanks to everyone who sent something in.
