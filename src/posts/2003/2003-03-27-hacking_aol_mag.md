Since, as expected, AOL Time Warner is pulling its most popular magazines [behind its subscription walls](http://news.com.com/2100-1025-994358.html?tag=fd_top), I figure it’s only a matter of time until someone sets up a site listing each weekly issue’s passwords, so that non-subscribers can read People and EW the same way that newsstand readers can.

The magazines come off the web the end of this month. I’m guessing we get the site before the end of next week.
