Note to dumb self: If you *still* can’t connect to the computer that’s 10 feet away from you, even after trying fifty million times, you might want to make sure you’re logged into your *own* wifi network, and not one of the 3 neighboring ones that surround you.

Note to dumb neighbor: Turn off file sharing. And run a spell-check on that cover letter before you send it, or there’s no chance that place is going to hire you.
