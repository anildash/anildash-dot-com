Another benefit you accrue by publishing your creations with more open licenses like the ones at [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) is that when you get [unanticipated surges in traffic](https://web.archive.org/web/20030210224635/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/1/4/125411/1900) due to being linked by a high-bandwidth site, savvy readers can know in advance that they have permission to mirror your content. And since the RDF part of a Commons license is machine readable, publishing tools can be updated to automatically create local copies of content if your license allows.
