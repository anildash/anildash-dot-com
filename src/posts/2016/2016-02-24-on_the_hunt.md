There are lots of conversations that I have over and over, one-at-a-time on social media like Twitter that I wish was captured more definitively. Fortunately, I got the chance to do just that when I was asked to be on [Product Hunt Live](https://www.producthunt.com/live/anil-dash), the Q&A series for the Product Hunt community.

I really appreciated the chance to talk about some of these topics more specifically in a way that others can refer to in the future; I hope youâ€™ll [give it a look](https://www.producthunt.com/live/anil-dash) and see what you think.
