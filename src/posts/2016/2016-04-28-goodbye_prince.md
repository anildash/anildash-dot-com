I’ve been struggling to find words to express how I feel in the week since Prince died. He’s obviously the artist that’s had the most impact on my life, and was in many ways the lens through which I processed the rest of pop culture and artistic expression.

I did tweet a bit about how I was feeling at the moment I found out, a series which both [Fusion](https://web.archive.org/web/20160422030301/http://fusion.net/story/294084/these-12-powerful-tweets-explain-just-why-prince-meant-so-much-to-so-many-people/) and [Mic](http://mic.com/articles/141507/this-series-of-tweets-perfectly-illustrates-what-prince-meant-to-his-fans) captured to try to explain Prince’s importance.

Later, I spoke with All Things Considered about a few facets of Prince’s innovative ways that perhaps get overlooked.

I’m sure I’ll have much, much more to say in the future, but for now I just wanted to say thank you to Prince for all that he shared with us, and to wish the best for the incredible community of fans that he brought together around the world, some of whom are amongst my oldest friends today.
