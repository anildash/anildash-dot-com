Back in November, I got to sit down with the amazing [Krista Tippett](http://www.onbeing.org/) for a lengthy interview in front of an incredibly warm crowd in Easton, MD. Now, that interview has been edited down and is available as [the latest episode](http://www.onbeing.org/program/anil-dash-tech-s-moral-reckoning/9132) of Krista’s hugely popular show, *On Being*.

I hope you’ll take a listen — we cover the contemporary tech industry, the social impact of the major social networks, and even the bigger reckoning with how tech is changing our families and or kids and our relationships. I’m really proud of how this came out, and can’t wait to hear what you think. And, of course, if you’re interested in more on the topic, you can check out my [Humane Tech](https://medium.com/humane-tech) series on Medium.

If you are interested, there’s also a [full, 90-minute unedited version](https://soundcloud.com/onbeing/unedited-anil-dash-with-krista-tippett) of the conversation. With Krista and her team coming from Minneapolis, the Prince mentions you might expect from me are in the uncut version.
