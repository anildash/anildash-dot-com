A list of things that have brightened my day today:

- Really good support from [NewsGator](http://www.newsgator.com/). I’m always glad people rave about our support team at Six Apart, and now I know how satisfying it is as a customer to have somebody respond quickly with a good answer.
- I’m still enjoying the debate from last week between a [number](http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2005/06/mule_design_stu.html)[of](http://www.muledesign.com/hoof/stable/kottke_and_dischord.php)[my](http://www.muledesign.com/hoof/stable/appropriation.php)[friends](http://www.kottke.org/05/06/theft-or-homage) about the [Minor Threat/Nike Major Threat](http://notes.torrez.org/2005/06/minor_ruckus.html) design appropriation. While I have an opinion (Jason and Andre are right, Mike and David are wrong), both sides are making really good, smart arguments, and that’s always fun to read.
- [Cam](http://overstated.net)‘s survey has [taken over the MIT homepage](http://mit.edu/). It’s so overwhelming it looks like he hacked the damn homepage. Right on.
- [Black Punk Time](http://www.roctober.com/roctober/blackpunk1.html). I could write a whole post about this great bit of writing, if I had the time. But everybody should read it.

Not a bad way to start a short week.
