More proof that the New York Times is the best paper in the world: [A Fake Michael Jackson’s Big Break: A Fake Trial](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/arts/television/01jack.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=). This important piece of journalism covers Edward Moss’s on-camera transformation into the King of Pop. Apparently, you have to do it with makeup, since you can’t buy necrotic flesh.

I guess [E’Casanova](http://mjnewsonline.com/interviews/ecasanova/) was busy.
