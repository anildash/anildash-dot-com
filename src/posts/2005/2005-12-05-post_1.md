Sometimes I miss when I used to just share random links with folks. So here’s what’s caught my eye lately.
[Greencine’s list of movies filmed in the Bay Area](http://www.greencine.com/list?action=viewList&amp;listID=4781) led me to a series of great before-and-after shots of [locations from Hitchcock’s *Vertigo*](http://www.basichip.com/vertigo/main.htm), with an amazing number of places looking virtually the same as they did fifty years ago. (If you don’t know, Greencine’s like Netflix for movie nerds, and they’ve got some [pretty](http://daily.greencine.com/)[good](http://pravda.greencine.com/) blogs that they’ve been running for a while.)

Not interested in California’s cinematic history? What about [Antarctic slang](http://penguincentral.com/MCMslang.html)? Dozens of new English coinages reflecting the distinct vernacular that arises in any extreme situation. Mercifully free of anything with a “blog-” prefix or a “-cast” suffix.

And one to bookmark for the next time you need to show how [Bernoulli’s principle really works](http://home.earthlink.net/~mmc1919/venturi.html). There’s a Java applet on the page, which is not only useful, but serves as a nice reminder for those who think Ajax is the first time a really good technology got overhyped.

Finally, since it’s already been pimped on [Hello, Nintendo](http://hello.typepad.com/hello_nintendo), it’s now safe for me to point to [KartMatch](http://kartmatch.ning.com/). It’s the demo app that Ning probably should have launched with in the first place. But in case you’re too lazy to click, the answer you’re looking for is 124614 405301.
