Prince.org has a great interview entitled "[ALAN LEEDS – THE QUESTIONS, THE ANSWERS & MORE BESIDES…](http://www.prince.org/msg/7/171968).", with some terrific insights from Alan Leeds, former tour manager for Prince, James Brown, and D’Angelo, among others. He’s also brother to sax fiend Eric Leeds, the Grammy-winning writer of the liner notes to the Star Time box set, and wrote the liners for Prince’s Hits set as well. Plus, he’s probably the most sane person to ever run a significant part of Prince’s affairs.
