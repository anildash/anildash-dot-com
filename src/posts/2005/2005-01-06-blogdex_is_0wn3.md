Right now, eight of the top ten links on [blogdex](http://blogdex.net) are about Six Apart and LiveJournal. We’re like the Usher and Alicia Keys of the Blogdex Top Ten. Huge!

To my new co-workers at Danga who’ll be coming to work with us in San Francisco, I thought I’d share some of the knowledge I’ve learned about this town:
