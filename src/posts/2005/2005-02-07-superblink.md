It’s perhaps the one article most designed to get bloggers to link to it: [Malcolm Gladwell interviewed on ESPN.com about the Superbowl](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/050203). Gladwell’s talking about how the ideas in [Blink](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0316172324/2020-20/) can apply to calling plays and making decisions during the game.
