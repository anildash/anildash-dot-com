Doing what weblogs do best, bringing a personal voice to public events: One of the two weblogs at the [Providence Journal](http://www.projo.com), [Subterranean Homepage News](http://www.projo.com/technology/shenews/), has provided a sobering look at the events surround the [workplace murders](http://www.projo.com/news/content/projo_20020612_shoot12.77f8c.html) of a few of their Journal coworkers.

A much lighter focus from the other blog, [Netrunner](http://www.projo.com/technology/netrunner/), which is covering the author’s assignment on the trial of [Buddy Cianci](http://www.buddycianci.com/), one of the last old-line scumbag mayors-for-life in America. He’s been pretty effectively known in the local community to be a thug, having dodged charges including rape and assault in the past, not to mention current charges of racketeering, extortion, conspiracy, mail fraud, and witness tampering. With a track record like that, I’ve of course loved monitoring his latest hijinks for years, and I’m quite curious to see how they finally bring him down.
