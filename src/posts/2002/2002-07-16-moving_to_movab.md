Well, that worked.

This main blog now runs on [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org). I put off switching from [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)[Pro](http://pro.blogger.com) for a long time, for a lot of reasons. First among these is that Blogger was, and is, a great product made by talented people whom I like and respect. I know a lot of people switch web tools all the time, or with little thought, but I struggled with the idea for a long time because I feel a particular loyalty to Blogger.

If you look all the way back to the oldest entries in the [Blogger directory](http://www.blogger.com/directory/dateCreatedDirectory_130.pyra), you’ll see that the only public blog older is [Ev](http://www.evhead.com)‘s, and that the other two of the same age as mine have both moved on from Blogger. So I kinda liked being able to say I was the oldest continuously-running Blogger blog except Ev’s.

The fact that I’m still going to run some of the other sections of this site on Blogger, and that I’d still recommend it unequivocally to anyone who’s starting out in the world of weblogs, says a lot for the product. But my needs have changed, and my programming skills have improved, and it’s time to use a new tool so I can do the things I want to add to this site.

It might not seem like much to you, but I’ve been doing this site one way, every day, for a long time now. This weblog is three years old on Saturday, and I started using Blogger pretty shortly after I started it. So it’s a habit that’ll be hard to change.

There’ll be some little things broken and in-progress the next few days, so bear with me.
