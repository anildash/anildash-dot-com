I am playing [Kevin](http://www.whygodwhy.com/lounge/)‘s version of “Desafinado” over and over. I will do so again tonight, when I finally get to read [Manual](http://www.whygodwhy.com/projects/manual/).

Which document, I think, should bear the inscription “Another Dean Allen Joint”, which I would also have appended to the [Web Standards Project relaunch](index.php?blogarch/2002_06_01_archive.php#85160051). Play on, playa.
