Before it shut down, useless shopping portal/browser toolbar dotcom [dash.com](http://dash.com) sawed through about [forty million dollars in funding](http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:8DHIBDraxsIC:www.dash.com/dash/CompanyRecentCoverWSJ.asp+dash.com+funding&amp;hl=en). I even considered a job there a few years ago, mostly so I could get the “anil@dash.com” email address that had eluded me. (I had originally set about to register dash.com back in ’95 or ’96, but got sidetracked and ended up with dashes.com.)

Needless to say, they shut down with the usual clunk of a dying dotcom, and now, a scant few months later, I have a Google lock on the name [Dash](http://www.google.com/search?q=dash).

Forty million dollars well spent, fellas!
