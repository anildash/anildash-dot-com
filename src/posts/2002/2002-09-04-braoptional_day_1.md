I had feared that our current mayor in New York City, Mike Bloomberg, did things a little differently than Rudy Giuliani. As summer winds down, I hadnâ€™t seen any sign of one of my favorite dog day traditions and was starting to lose heart. But today, my faith was restored. Another [bra-optional day](http://dashes.com/anil/2001/05/braoptional-day.html). Thanks, Mike!
