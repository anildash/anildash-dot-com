People ask me why I live in New York City, and sometimes the best answer I can give is because when friends visit, I can go look at [The Starry Night](http://www.moma.org/collection/paintsculpt/vangogh.starry.html) and then in the next room they can see [cheese made from my friendâ€™s milk](http://www.bluishorange.com/newyork/index.php4?x=4).
