I redid the way my [Daily Links](http://www.dashes.com/links/) work, so I’ll be able to do a lot more with them. For the 99% of you who don’t know what those are, the sidebar here is what’s been sucking up all my attention from the writing I used to do on this site. One of the improvements is that the [XML feed](http://www.dashes.com/links/index.rdf) for the links has stopped sucking like it used to, and now works right. There’s also an [RSS .91 version](http://www.dashes.com/links/index.xml). I still have to fix the ability to work with the Mozilla sidebar and pretty up the stylesheet, but the fact that the RSS works right and is linked on my sidebar should answer most of the questions I get.

Since I killed an evening getting all this stuff fixed, I guess I should ask: Does anybody read this stuff other than me?
