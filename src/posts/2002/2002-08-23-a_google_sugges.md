While hanging out last night, as I am wont to do,

With several ex-members of the [Deja](http://www.surf-bits.com/dejanews.html) crew,

I pulled [Lane](http://www.monstro.com) over and gave him the scoop

On how I would improve [Google Groups](http://www.google.com/grphp).

I’d let the empowered user choose

How the browser should handle the prefix **news://**

By using a button on the [bar](http://toolbar.google.com/), of course,

Or by using the one that’s [open source](http://googlebar.mozdev.org/).

Instead of a separate tool being launched

I’d stay right in my browser for all my [alt.sex](news://alt.sex) raunch.

My need for a reader would certainly cease;

I’d tell Outlook Express to Rest in Peace.
