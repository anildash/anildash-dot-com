I had this one on the [Daily Links](http://dashes.com/links) already yesterday, but I’m still curious: What happened to [Southern Partisan](http://www.templeofdemocracy.com/SouthernPartisan.htm)‘s [website](http://www.southernpartisan.org/)? All the content is gone, though of course, not from the [Google cache](http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:eBCSE-n1_sIC:www.southern-partisan.com/masthead.html+southern+partisan&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8).

What I want to know is, given the fact that this nutbag racist rag’s roster of writers has included, over the years, such luminaries as John Ashcroft and Newt Gingrich, is their (attempted) disappearance from the web trying to prevent any more conservatives from having to face Lott’s lot?
