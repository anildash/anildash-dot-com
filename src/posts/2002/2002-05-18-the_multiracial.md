From [United States v. Thind](http://www.multiracial.com/government/thind.html), 261 U.S. 204 (1923):

> It may be true that the blond Scandinavian and the brown Hindu have a common ancestor in the dim reaches of antiquity, but the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences between them today…

> It is a matter of familiar observation and knowledge that the physical group characteristics of the Hindus render them readily distinguishable from the various groups of persons in this country commonly recognized as white. The children of English, French, German, Italian, Scandinavian, and other European parentage, quickly merge into the mass of our population and lose the distinctive hallmarks of their European origin. On the other hand, it cannot be doubted that the children born in this country of Hindu parents would retain indefinitely the clear evidence of their ancestry.

Yessir, that’s my Supreme Court. Not only did the Thind ruling declare that Indians in the United States were unfit for citizenship, it stripped many Indian-American citizens who had *already* been naturalized of their citizenship rights. Asian Americans have consistently been the only group of people in the United States for whom rights have been taken away *after* being granted to them.
