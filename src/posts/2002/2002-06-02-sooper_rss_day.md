It’s super RSS/XML day today. The [RSS 0.91 feed](anil.xml) for this site has been back for a little while, and it’s augmented by two new feeds, the [Village Voice Most Popular](http://villagevoice.com/most_popular_rss.php) and the [Village Voice Most Emailed](http://villagevoice.com/most_emailed_rss.php) Top 10 lists, both as RSS 1.0 feeds.

The feed on my site is [auto-discoverable](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1475), of course. Make sure to use the [correct attributes](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/02.html#important_change_to_the_link_tag) on your link tag if you do the same. I’ll also be putting together a javascript include for those Voice feeds later, but feel free to play with them and [let everybody know](javascript:viewComments(85137072)) if you do something cool with them.
