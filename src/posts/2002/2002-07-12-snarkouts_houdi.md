If I had to choose, I’d pick the company of smart friends rather than being smarter myself. An example of why is the terrific [exploration of Houdini’s life](http://www.snarkout.org/archives/00000171.html) that Steve put together a while ago. I had read a lot of these little references in different places over the years, but never synthesized it all like that. Beautiful.
