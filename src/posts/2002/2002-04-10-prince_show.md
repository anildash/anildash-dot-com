I just got back from a two and a half hour show where Prince led a band consisting of, at various times, George Clinton, Maceo Parker, Larry Graham, [?uestlove](https://web.archive.org/web/20020604115848/http://www.okayplayer.com/archives/archive.jsp?eid=258) of the Roots, [Musiq](https://web.archive.org/web/20210223154523/http://www.defsoul.com/musiq/splashflash.htm), Alicia Keys, Candy Dulfer, Doug E. Fresh, and Renato Neto, a terrific keyboard player who looks a hell of a lot like [David Wertheimer](http://netwert.com). Then on the way out I walked into Chris Rock and he said hello.

I got into the show free with the help of [Greg Boyer](https://web.archive.org/web/20020220153848/http://members.aol.com/dieposaune/gregboyerindex.html?mtbrand=AOL_US), who kicked ass on trombone at the Maceo show back in [December](/2001/12/28/i_saw_maceo_par/) and he came through again tonight.

The best part? That was just the *afterparty*; the 4-hour Prince concert at Lincoln Center (including sitting in on the sound check) that preceded it was even better. All you shoe-gazing indie rock motherfuckers are gonna regret someday that you didnâ€™t find the funk back when you was still young enough to shake that ass.
