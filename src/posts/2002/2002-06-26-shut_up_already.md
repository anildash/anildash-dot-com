Because he’s the king of such things, [George](http://www.allaboutgeorge.com) gives me a definitive talkin’-at-the-movies article with Kathy Wilson’s [Shut Up, Already, Damn!](http://www.citybeat.com/2002-05-23/cover9.shtml) (bonus points for the Prince reference) which does a fine job of addressing her ambivalence and pride in the tradition of talking black at movies.

But don’t read it for the high-minded social commentary, read it ’cause it’s goddamned *funny*, especially considering it’s a reprise of an *All Things Considered* piece. And if you want to see what an actual discussion of race and culture looks like, go read [the comments](http://www.allaboutgeorge.com/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=117) on [George’s post](http://www.allaboutgeorge.com/past/000117.html#000117) about Angela Bassett’s dis of Halle Berry’s character/role in "Monster’s Ball". Extra credit for spotting the thinly-veiled anti-Semitism in [Donald](http://www.anzidesign.com/)‘s comments.
