If you can overlook the abominable layout, this [thorough description](http://www.mvps.org/word/FAQs/General/WordPerfectConverters.htm) of the technical differences between the file formats of WordPerfect and Microsoft Word serves as an interesting analog to the difference between tag-soup HTML and properly applied, CSS-formatted semantic HTML.

Their current relative market shares might be considered somewhat significant. Also, note the difficulty in translating WordPerfectâ€™s proprietary printing system to the standard Windows model. I remember dealing with that particular problem with my clients around the time of the DOS-to-Windows shift, and the idiocy of having to install an application-specific printer driver for a Windows program still boggles my mind today.

Like most Microsoft competitors, it seemed like they were determined to help Microsoft win their market as quickly as possible.
