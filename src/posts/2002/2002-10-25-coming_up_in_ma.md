Just a heads-up on next week’s [magazine](__GHOST_URL__/magazine/), I’ll be posting the promised follow-up to [Why Tablet PCs Will Succeed](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/why_tablet_pcs_will_succeed.php), explaining why weblogs are the Tablet PC’s killer app, and why Microsoft can’t admit that.

Also, I’ll be posting here in response to a lot of [great feedback](http://www.brownhen.com/2002_10_20_backhen.html#83468153) I got on [Introducing the Microcontent Client](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/introducing_the_microcontent_client.php). If you haven’t had a chance to check those pieces out, take the time, I’d love to hear more feedback.
