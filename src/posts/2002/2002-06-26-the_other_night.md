The other night, I paused to look back over my shoulder at the stars in the sky, and I [created the Big Bang](http://www.discover.com/june_02/featuniverse.html):

> Using a light source and an arrangement of mirrors to provide a number of possible photon routes, the physicists were able to show that the paths the photons took were not fixed until the physicists made their measurements, even though those measurements were made after the photons had already left the light source and begun their circuit through the course of mirrors.
