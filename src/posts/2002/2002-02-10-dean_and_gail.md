Just go read it. It’s the [Vancouver Sun’s rendition](http://www.canada.com/vancouver/vancouversun/story.asp?id=%7B787C26D4-F7CA-40B7-9202-E96B597223C7%7D) of the story of [Dean](http://www.textism.com/) and [Gail](http://www.openbrackets.com/) and language and love and, in passing, [Stewart](http://www.sylloge.com/personal/) and [Caterina](http://www.caterina.net), and hope and the Atlantic Ocean and happily ever after.

It’s the reason we have all this technology, ya know. They’re just tools to help us find someone else who shares our insanity.
