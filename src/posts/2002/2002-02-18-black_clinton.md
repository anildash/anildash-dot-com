"[[Bill Clinton] becomes an invisible white man. He becomes a black man in the pews.](http://www.africana.com/Column/bl_lines_36.htm)" Civil rights leader Joseph Lowery, discussing Clinton’s comfort with the idiom of black churches, evokes and inverts Ralph Ellison. The quote was spawned by reflection upon the release of DeWayne Wickham’s “[Bill Clinton and Black America](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345450329/ref=ase_electronicfro-20/102-5706441-1174525)“.
