Because everybody who’s seen it loves it, I guess I should post [Triumph the Insult Comic Dog](http://www.mavericktimes.com/triumph.html)‘s [interviews with Star Wars fans](stuff/Triumph%20-%20Star%20Wars%20Nerds.wmv) (also at [ifilm](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilm/product/film_info/0,3699,2439321,00.html)) who were camping out for Episode 2. It’s truly, painfully hysterical.

Somehow I can’t get this out of my head when I see invitations for the [Fark party](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/farkpartyNYC/) or the [Mozilla 1.0 Release party](http://meetzilla.mozdev.org/events/mozilla-1.0.html).

Update: Oh, and I met the Dragonmaster you see in the Triumph video. Check it out [here](stuff/dragonmaster.jpg).
