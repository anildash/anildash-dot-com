I have a lot of thoughts about systems and how they work, and how we can teach systems thinking to others. Maybe one good place we could start is by capturing <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1103294393686069248">this old tweet of mine</a>, which probably deserves a permanent home since I don't use Twitter anymore:

Most of what gets shared as heartwarming stories are usually temporary, small-scale responses to systemic failures. I wish we found it just as inspirational to make structural changes to unjust systems, but I donâ€™t know if our culture knows how to tell those stories.
