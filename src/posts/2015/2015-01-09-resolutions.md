I’m not prone to making grand New Year’s resolutions, but my friend Jessamyn West asked me to think a bit about what changes I’d make to my online activity, and I was glad to jot down some brief notes. You should check it out, for all the thoughtful things that were suggested by people smarter than me.

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://medium.com/message/our-internet-resolutions-f40f84b28115">Our Internet Resolutions</a></h4><p>I made internet resolutions this year. In January I break down the segments of my life that I want to inspect and maybe improve. Work, hobby, social. Mind, body, spirit. Partner, family, friends. Town, state, world. Inner, outer, cosmic. It's -15° outside. What else is there to do but put things into boxes then unpack and rearrange them?</p></blockquote>
