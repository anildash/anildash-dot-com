Here’s a lesson in how software development works.

Say you’d like to port a popular arcade game to your home video console. You can give a guy like Tod Frye four months to do a good-enough version of Pac-Man. It’ll sell 7 million copies, even though it looks... not great.

*Or*, you can wait for 30 years of refinement and improvement in understanding of Atari software development, give someone three years to develop their own version of Pac-Man and end up with a [near-flawless clone](http://atariage.com/forums/topic/229152-new-pacman-for-atari-2600/) of the arcade original.

It will sell zero million copies.
