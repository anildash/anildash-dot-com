Toward the end of every year, as people are thinking of making donations to charities either as an act of goodwill, or to help reduce their tax burden, or both, I try to work with my online networks to help out causes I believe in. And every year, I’m blown away by the generosity and creativity of the people I’m connected to.

2014 was no exception in this regard. First, we tried to help [Family Care International](http://www.familycareintl.org/en/home), which fights for reproductive health and education around the world. The response was extraordinary.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Okay, here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing. For the next hour, you donate to <a href="https://twitter.com/familycareintl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@familycareintl</a> &amp; I&#39;ll match you. GO! <a href="https://t.co/PqXO3fI3nq">https://t.co/PqXO3fI3nq</a></p>&mdash; anildash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/547822383978266624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In just *one hour* we managed to raise $1175 for <a href="https://twitter.com/familycareintl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@familycareintl</a>! We&#39;ll round up to $1200 and double it. That&#39;s $2400 in 60 minutes. :)</p>&mdash; anildash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/547837919126618112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2014</a></blockquote>

As amazing as that was, it didn’t prepare me for what was next. We set out to support [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/), and provide resources for schools and teachers in need.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alright, let&#39;s do this! For the next hour, give to a <a href="https://twitter.com/DonorsChoose?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DonorsChoose</a> project, tell me what you gave &amp; I&#39;ll match it: <a href="http://t.co/cwzhEiaHJb">http://t.co/cwzhEiaHJb</a></p>&mdash; anildash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/550374339686977536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2014</a></blockquote>

And my incredible network of friends astounded me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What we can do together: In one hour, we teamed up and raised $7905 for <a href="https://twitter.com/DonorsChoose?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DonorsChoose</a>. Thank you, and thanks to everyone who teaches!</p>&mdash; anildash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/550392267903873024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2014</a></blockquote> 

I don’t ever take for granted that I’ve been given an incredible platform on these various social networks, and I thank everybody who’s inspired me by trying to give back using these ridiculous little technological tools.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So the end of the year seems like as good a time as any to say thank you. I appreciate that you all spend some time/attention with me here.</p>&mdash; anildash (@anildash) <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/550396242518618112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2014</a></blockquote>
