Sometimes I get an idea in my head and I just can’t let it go. For a few months, I’ve heard this nagging sound in the back of my mind, asking me to revisit *Amadeus*, one of my favorite films ever.

Because who among us hasn’t heard Jeremih intone, “shots…shotsshotsshots” and cursed god for capriciously gifting this man with such talent while the rest of us mortals can only bask in his genius?
