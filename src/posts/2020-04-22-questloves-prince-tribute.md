There could be no more fitting remembrance of Prince than Questlove going deep into his catalog and spinning some of Prince's greatest works into a multi-hour DJ set. Unless Quest did that *five nights in a row*. Which he did! It was an absolutely monumental marathon of nightly live streams for the better part of a week, often ending in the wee hours of the morning.

So, [Miss TLC](https://twitter.com/iammisstlc) and I felt obligated to do justice to that herculean effort by documenting the sets as they happened, adding live liner notes covering everything from the song titles (responding to the incessant queries of "what song is this?" in the Instagram comments) to never-before-known bits of trivia shared by some of Prince's collaborators who dropped in to witness these already-legendary sets.

I hope you'll take a moment to read our notes, to listen to Quest's sets as you're able, and to remember one of the bravest and most inspiring artists we've ever gotten to enjoy. And if the spirit moves you to explore Prince's catalog for yourself, here are a [few great places to start](__GHOST_URL__/2017/02/12/its_time_to_discover_prince/), along with [every single video Prince ever made](__GHOST_URL__/2018/11/28/every-single-video-prince-ever-made/).

Oh, and if you're a geek? I wrote up a whole article on how I [made the app to do all these live liner notes](https://dev.to/glitch/i-built-an-app-to-accompany-questlove-s-dj-set-in-20-minutes-5ep4) â€” in the 20 minutes before Quest started his set. Please do give it a look!
