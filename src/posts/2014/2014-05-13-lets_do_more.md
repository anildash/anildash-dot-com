I’ve been trying to do more things that are unfamiliar or slightly out of my comfort zone lately. Here’s a quick roundup:

- I got to participate in Rhizome’s venerated [Seven on Seven](http://rhizome.org/sevenonseven/) conference, where I teamed up with [Kevin McCoy](http://mccoyspace.com/) to create [monegraph](http://www.monegraph.com/). It’s a system that uses the block chain technology which underpins Bitcoin, but puts it to work in service of artists, so that they can verify that a digital work is an original, with a verifiable provenance. I describe the context of the work in [A Bitcoin for Digital Art](https://medium.com/message/8c7db719e495), my first piece for Medium’s “The Message” collection, and we also showed it off with [a demo](http://techcrunch.com/video/monegraph-a-cryptocurrency-for-digital-art/518221293/) at the most improbable of venues, [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/09/monegraph/)‘s Disrupt conference. The response overall has been great, as you can tell from the [monegraph tumblr](http://monegraph.tumblr.com/).

- The White House’s working group on Big Data and Privacy [released its report](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/05/01/fact-sheet-big-data-and-privacy-working-group-review), which is surprisingly thoughtful and appropriately nuanced in its consideration of the issues. As [danah so aptly summarized it](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2014/05/01/white-house-big-data.html), “[T]he conversation around the “big data” phenomenon tends to get quickly polarized – it’s good or it’s bad, plain and simple. But it’s never that simple.” It’s no surprise danah’s take was so thoughtful; her [Data & Society Research Institute](http://www.datasociety.net/) was one of the most valuable contributors to the White House report. In my role on the board of the DSRI, I got to moderate a panel with [Kate Crawford](http://www.katecrawford.net/), [Steven Hodas](http://about.me/stevenhodas), [Alondra Nelson](http://alondranelson.com/), and [Shamina Singh](https://twitter.com/shaminasingh). The conversation was incredible, and so it’s no surprise that our panel was [cited in the full report](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf) from the White House. You can watch the panel here:

  
 * Over on The Awl, it’s “[How to Avoid Raising a Monster](http://www.theawl.com/2014/05/corrupt-your-children)” which takes a look at my, uh, parenting style. This includes the question, “Can you … provide some more examples of when you’ve been especially tempted to do things that wouldn’t be found in any guidebooks on how best to raise a child?”  
 * On PolicyMic, a nice piece on [23 Ways Feminism Has Made the World Better for Men](http://www.policymic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men) includes my least insightful comment ever: “Sex is fun!”  
 * Coming up this fall: I’ll be [speaking at PopTech](http://poptech.org/rebellion) in October. If you know that conference, you know why I’m geeked out about the opportunity, especially given that John Maeda as host has chosen “rebellion” as the theme for the event.  
 * Oh, and Prince finally retweeted [one of my tweets](https://twitter.com/anildash/status/461718105841209345), but elided my name and then removed the tweet entirely a brief while later, as he is prone to do. But still, fun for me!  
 * And as always, [the ThinkUp team has been rocking](http://blog.thinkup.com/) with a whole range of fun and ridiculous new insights in the app. If you haven’t seen ThinkUp lately, you haven’t seen it. You should probably [sign up](https://www.thinkup.com/) and give it a try.
