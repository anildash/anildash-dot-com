Leave it to [Tog](http://www.asktog.com/readerMail/2000-01ReaderMail.html) to come up with this clever little quote:

> Apple has, of course, always had a multi-button mouse. It’s just that the other buttons�Command, Option, and Shift�were on the keyboard. Now, instead of adding a second button for use with pop-up menus, they’ve squandered the Control key. **Foolish.**
