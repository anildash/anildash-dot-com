**Interesting:** I thought .NET was all hype, but checking out the development environment described for the platform on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0900/Framework/Framework.asp) makes me excited as a programmerâ€¦ would be nice to have that kind of flexibility in development today.

Features such tidbits as:

> In fact, Rational is planning to create a Java-language compiler that targets the .NET common language runtime.

and:

> In fact, installing most .NET-based applications will require no more than copying the files to a directory, and uninstalling an application will be as easy as deleting those files.
