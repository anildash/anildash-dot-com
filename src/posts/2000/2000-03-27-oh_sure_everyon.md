Oh, sure, everyone objects to the [AOL Keyboard](http://www.salon.com/tech/log/2000/03/24/aol_keyboard/index.html), but that’s nothing… the [i-Opener](http://www.netpliance.com) that I’ve ordered (it still hasn’t arrived yet) has a **Pizza Key**. And even better, it’s **right next to the space bar**.

But at least it links to [Papa John’s](http://www.papajohns.com).
