Is there a way to automate turning [Bookmarklets](http://www.bookmarklets.com) into [DeepLeap plug-ins](http://www.deepleap.org) yet? There oughtta be.

Speaking of which, this [Up Button](javascript:void(location.href=location.href.substring(0,location.href.substring(0,location.href.length-1).lastIndexOf('/')+1))) is the bookmarklet I use most, constantly while browsing. Especially helpful with 404’s, **makes hacking URL’s almost automatic**. I have been meaning for months to get around to writing the full install to actually put a button on the IE5/Win toolbar that would go between the Back and Forward buttons, but until then, drag this to your toolbar.
