From [Bird on a wire](http://students.washington.edu/lwinn/bird/):

> [Ew.](http://www.michaeldouglas.com) How about I just give you $39.99 a year to stop appearing in movies? Or at least to stop playing leading men? I’m serious. How much will it take?

This is *too* true. I hate that this man still has a career, it’s somewhere between creepy and disgusting.
