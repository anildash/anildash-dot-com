Does anyone know the name (or even better, the URL) of the **cabal of designers** who dictate each year/season’s color palette? Every year, I read some obscure Page 42 story about the chromatic Illuminati, and every year I forget who the hell they are, except that it’s always *way* too Euro and that the colors look very bad against my brown skin.

[Clue me in](mailto:anil@dashes.com).

Also, [Dan](http://www.wwa.com/~dhartung/weblog/index.html) says:

> Practically any kind of pet can inspire a subculture. Apparently Dachsunds are problem pets and therefore a [Dachshund Rescue network](http://www.drwp.net/links.html) has sprung up, including a [Dachsund Underground Railroad](Dachsund Underground Railroad).

Unfortunately, this reminds me of one of the **saddest moments of my life**, the day my parents had to take our dog Baba (pronounced Bubba by me) to a **Dachshund Rescue Farm** where he was adopted by a kindly lady who kept him in the company of a whole farm-load of other ill-behaved dachshunds.

Those who know me a little may wonder if I’m being sarcastic… Those who know me well know that, sadly, I am not.

Although it *is* comforting to notice that Dan doesn’t know how the hell to spell "dachshund" either…
