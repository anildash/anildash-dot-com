Now, I’m no Giuliani sympathizer, but after the hellish week he’s had, it just seems like piling on for [Time Daily](http://www.time.com/time/daily/0,2960,44993-101000511,00.html) to say this:

> So with Giuliani up to his massive forehead in reasons to get out of the Senate race he’s not quite in yet � from prostate cancer to the prospect of a very ugly and public divorce � political wagerers might want to grab the last good odds that he’ll take a pass.

**Massive forehead**? Ha ha ha!
