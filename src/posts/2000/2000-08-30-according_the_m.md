According the MS press release, [Office 10](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Aug00/BetaPR.asp) has two features that seem like they would have been **perfect with DeepLeap**:

- **Native XML support. **Excel and Access now support XML as a file format and can easily import and export XML data. This enables organizations to build solutions that integrate Excel or Access as the front end to XML-based data structures to improve corporate reporting and analysis.
- **Extensible Smart Tag architecture. **Smart Tags are built on an extensible architecture so that developers can create new Smart Tags to help Office users gather information from the Web, such as accessing real-time sales or inventory data while working in Excel.
