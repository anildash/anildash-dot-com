I saw Wu-Tang Clan last night, and it was predictably entertaining, even though I’m not a huge fan. But the reason I think it will turn out to be quite memorable is because **O.D.B. was there**. Expectedly, he was largely incoherent, confusing, and quite amusing. Somehow, I don’t think we’ll ever see all 9 members together on one stage again after last night…
