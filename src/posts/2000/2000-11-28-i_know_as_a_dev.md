I know as a developer I’m supposed to hate Microsoft, but I’m really impressed by the whole (idiotically named) .NET thingy. ([Good explanation here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/welcome/dsmsdn/drguinet11202000.htm).) But what surprises me is how they’ve implemented some stuff already, including taking the existing TerraServer and making it available for web use as [TerraService](http://terraserver.microsoft.net/TerraService_Overview.htm). I can already think of a bunch of database projects I’d want to link to this…
