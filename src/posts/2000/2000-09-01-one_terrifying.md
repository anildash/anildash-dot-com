One terrifying bit of info from [ZDNet’s writeup of Microsoft at 25](http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2622108,00.html?chkpt=zdhpnews01):

> [Brian MacDonald] has been a behind-the-scenes guy ever since Microsoft bought his company in 1989 and turned its technology into the product currently known as Microsoft Project. After that, MacDonald started and led the group that built Microsoft’s Outlook e-mail client.

And then later in the article…

> As a result of Microsoft’s early August reorganization, MacDonald reports to Microsoft veteran Bob Muglia, who is now group vice president of the .Net Services Group. Muglia’s group is charged with developing software, subscription services and a **new .Net user interface**. [Emphasis mine.]

Uhhh… the guy who gave us Project and *Outlook* is in the *user interface* group? That seems scary.
