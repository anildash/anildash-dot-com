So I’ve been up to my butt in new work, leaving little time for updates of any value here, but I’ve had a few random thoughts in the past few days that I wanted to jot down….

First up, why can’t I export **all of a product’s (or category’s) reviews** from [Epinions](http://anildash.epinions.com) into [AvantGo](http://www.avantgo.com)? I want to get all the restaurant reviews from a 4-block area on my Palm so I can choose at my leisure on the subway.

Or at least, I *would* want to, if I had a Palm.

I can’t remember the other good point I had, my brain is fried….
