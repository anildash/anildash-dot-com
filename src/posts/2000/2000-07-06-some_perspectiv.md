Some perspective: an interesting Netcraft report on [Business Models for the Web](http://www.netcraft.com/market.html), originally from May, 1995. Wonderful how much of the advice is still useful, although the most striking thing about this document to me in hindsight was that it was written *before*[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) existed.
