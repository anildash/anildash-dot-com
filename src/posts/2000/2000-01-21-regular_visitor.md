Regular visitors will know that I’m deeply enamored of musical artists who **take ownership of their own works**. Interestingly, many of them were among my favorites *before* they became independent, but then went their own way as part of their natural inclination. As I quoted here once before, **everything that rises must converge**…

Anyway, in light of [this scary news](http://www.livedaily.com/archive/2000/2k01/wk3/AmendmentToCopyrightActCo.html) (Thanks to [Rebecca’s Pocket](http://www.rebeccablood.net/) for the link), I’d suggest you go take a look at some talented musicians who, while still usually working within the existing confines of the music industry, have been able to hold on to at least *some* control of their works.

(In no particular order.) [Aimee Mann](http://www.aimeemann.com), [George Michael](http://www.aegean.net/), [Jonatha Brooke](http://www.jonathabrooke.com), (The Former) [Prince](http://www.prince.org) (not official site), [Public Enemy](http://www.publicenemy.com), [Ani Difranco](http://www.hazenet.com/Oo/ani/linklisting.html) (not official site), [Arto Lindsay](http://www.artolindsay.com), [Shawn Smith](http://www.818music.com/shawn_page.htm).

Obviously, just a partial list, but I guarantee that you’ve heard of at least a few of those artists, and I would expect you’d like at least a few of them, and wouldn’t you really rather give your money to them than to The Man? I thought so.
