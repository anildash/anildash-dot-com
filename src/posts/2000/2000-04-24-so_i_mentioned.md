So I mentioned how much **I like the new PocketPC’s**… but one of the coolest parts ([Cam](http://www.camworld.com), are you listening?) is that many parts of the PocketPC interface are implemented as HTML, which makes sense since it’s a simple, single-click interface that can be well represented with text and a few .gifs.

I already replaced the logo on the "Today" startup page ([image](http://www.wiredguy.com/reviews/sr/pocketapps/images/today01.gif)), and I’m seeing just how involved the editing can get… help files are standard HTML, too.
