Today's most fun new [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) app is Record Player, which lets you upload a photo, then uses Google Cloud's Vision API to recognize the image and play it on Spotify.

It works really well, but the real fun starts when you upload a selfie or a picture of yourself.

I especially love that this was made by [Patrick Weaver](https://twitter.com/patrickweave_r) on the [Mouse.org](https://mouse.org) team, because it makes me think that kids learning computer science from Mouse curriculum here in NYC are going to start by seeing tech as enabling fun apps like this one! And you can, of course, [View Source](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/record-player?path=README.md:1:0) for the app and remix it to make your own variations.
