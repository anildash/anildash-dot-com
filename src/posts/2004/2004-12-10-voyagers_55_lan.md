The Voyager spacecraft had their famous galactic greetings on board, with the map offering detailed instructions for any aliens who wanted to invade Earth, the drawing of a naked man and woman designed to make me giggle when I saw it depicted in my fifth grade science textbook, and the shiny golden record containing greetings from around the world.

Iâ€™m quite pleased to see that the [greetings in 55 languages](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/languages/languages.html) can be downloaded. They even have [my first language](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/languages/oriya.html) covered.
