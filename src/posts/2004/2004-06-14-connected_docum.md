I’ll pay $100 to the first person who figures out how to make [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) (worst name ever! I still call it Hydra) and [OneNote service pack](http://www.microsoft.com/office/onenote/prodinfo/sp1/default.mspx)‘s document-editing capabilities connect to each other.

Both allow multiple users to edit the same document, and both connect easily across a network, though they’ve got different areas of focus. And both are pretty great little apps that *ought* to connect together. Though Word has note-taking features in the new Office 2004 for the Mac, I suspect the MBU’s distance from the Office group that’s doing OneNote on Windows will mean that it’s going to be a long time until note-sharing on the two platforms works well in Office.

Get to work, LazyWeb!
