If you’re part of our crew watching our fellow bloggers make their way through the NYC Marathon this Sunday, [take a look at the map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dj/1244945/) on Flickr and sign in to let everyone know where you’ll be watching from. I’d love to be able to assemble shots of everyone from each major milestone along the way. I’m betting this is the first marathon with a substantial number of people moblogging the event while running.
