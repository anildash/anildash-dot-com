I think the media inaccuracy witch hunt is reaching its zenith. (Or perhaps its nadir.) Brian Williams is [being slammed](http://www.nypost.com/gossip/32587.htm) for saying that there are no black members of the of the Senate, and that it’s a bigger problem than there being no black television news anchors on the major networks. I’d read his comments in the United in-flight magazine when they were published, and I agreed with him then. The thing is, despite Obama’s status as a senator-elect, Williams is *correct*. There are currently no black members of the Senate.

Also, even after Obama begins his term, there will be one black member of the Senate. That’s **still a sign that something’s wrong**, people. So, in addition to being factually correct, the general issue Williams was raising, that almost every kind of American is underrepresented in the Senate, and that legislative underrepresentation is a greater danger than journalistic representation, is also correct. So, to recap: Correct in the letter of what he said, and correct in the spirit of what he was communicating.

Fact-checkers, fire away!
