Most people in western societies don’t understand the concept of karma very well, or at least they don’t articulate it in a way that’s consistent with its traditional spiritual meaning. Naturally, as a bit of a pedant, it seems important to me to correct this misconception. Karma is something that happens on the scale of multiple lifetimes, like evolution, not shorthand for "payback is a bitch". Of course, that’s something a bit vague in a culture like ours where "forever" is usually used to represent "until I die" as opposed to, well, *forever*. Still, it’s an important distinction.

But, like any concept of faith which transcends an individual’s lifetime, some people use the "well I’ll be dead then" argument to justify being unkind. I like to see it as justification for the opposite behavior; There’s something quite appealing about the sense that progress is based on the sum total of your decisions and actions. Leaves a little more room for making mistakes and meandering around a bit while figuring out how to live one’s life.

Usually when I articulate the actual meaning of karma to people, which is usually in a context somewhat akin to correcting their grammar, I immediately get the question, "Well, if it only happens after you die, what do you think of [Instant Karma](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000457L2/2020-20/)?" After hastening to point out that karma doesn’t happen after you die, but rather as you progress to your next life, I usually explain that, to me at least, something like John Lennon’s work is an artistic expression of a concept, and one that I find pretty appealing. Instant karma doesn’t exist, of course, in Hindu or Buddhist tradition. But it’s kind of like trying to [Do the Evolution](http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/PearlJam/chords/dtevid.html), a nice way to try to get control of something that’s bigger than just your own life, or lifetime.
