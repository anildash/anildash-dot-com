Okay, there are services that [handle eBay for me](http://www.auctiondrop.com/) if I’m too lazy to sell my junk. Which I am. But what I need is a service which will handle [Free After Rebate products](http://www.freeafterrebate.info/) for me. I’d trust them to be my purchasing proxy, perhaps with one of those single-use credit card numbers, in exchange for a guarantee that they’d process the rebate claim form.

Even with a one or two dollar processing fee per rebate, I’d still come out way ahead, and someone could build a decent service business. Anyone know someone who’s offering this?
