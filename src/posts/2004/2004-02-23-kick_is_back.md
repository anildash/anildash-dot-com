Just a reminder to everyone attending the South by Southwest Interactive Festival next month, the annual kickball game [KICK!](http://www.dashes.com/kick/archives/kick_is_coming_back.php) is returning for the third year. The game will be on Saturday, March 13, at 11:30a. Our location is Palm Park, the same as last year.

Be sure to pass the word on to everyone you know who’ll be at SXSW this year, and we’ll see you at the game.
