So, starting today, I’ll be on vacation for a week or so. While I’m gone, you might want to check out the [Six Apart Professional Network](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/), where I do all of my weblog-related blogging these days. There should be some cool stuff posted there while I’m gone as well. I’ll probably also keep updating my [moblog](http://www.anildash.com/photos/onthego3/) while I’m gone, and hopefully launching a revamped and redesigned version of this site when I return.

Yep, when I’m on vacation, I work on redesigning my blog. It’s amazing I have friends and family who accept me the way I am.

Some of the ideas I’m kicking around for the new site include, besides a visual revamp, displaying comments in the same way that regular posts are displayed, to see if it affects comment quality or tone.

Let me know what else I should be adding.
