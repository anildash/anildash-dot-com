My friends, let us all come together on the one day of the year that unites us all, regardless of color, creed, or nationality, and join voices in harmony to sing the message that stirs all of our hearts:

Stop with the goddamned stupid April Foolâ€™s jokes on the web, already. Nobody wants to waste all day tomorrow looking at that crap.
