Just a quick note to my few friends in Spain… I had my first chance to visit your beautiful country last year, and though I didn’t get to Madrid, I did get to spend enough time to start to appreciate the people and the culture. I wish I didn’t know what it’s like to go through a day like your country has today, but unfortunately, as a New Yorker, I think I have a good idea.

Our thoughts are with you today, as yours were with us two and a half years ago. I can’t explain or understand what happened today, but I can vouch for the fact that it does get more bearable in time.
