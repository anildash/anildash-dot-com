I hate to contradict Ken Mehlman’s desires, but I think, instead of [flooding the web with assertions that a candidate won](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/politics/campaign/05CND-SPIN.html) after the vice presidential debate, people who are interested in politics should flood the web with, well, their *honest opinions* of the issues that were discussed and the performances of the two men.

Call me crazy, but it seems there’s something dishonest about deciding one’s opinion *before* an event has happened.
