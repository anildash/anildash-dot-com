Today, as an exercise, we will contrast Peter Merholz’s [ruminations on Konfabulator](http://www.peterme.com/archives/000426.html) with the lyrics to [Ghostface Killah’s feelings about the Sun](http://www.lyricsbox.com/raekwon-the-chef-lyrics-the-sun-l2l7v2s.html), as expressed in “The Sun”, from [Bulletproof Wallets](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005RGNW/ref=2020-20).
**Ghostface:** “Look at the sun so pretty today, it’s so bright, it’s so smashing”.
**Peterme:** “As the description says, ‘Simulates the motion of the sun across your desktop.’ That’s all it does. And I love it.”
**Ghostface:** “He’ll sit right there, even if you pull your gun out; He can never run out, when the lights go out; It’s Japan’s turn now, the earth has spun around; I see Yellow and Green, it’s a beautiful thing; The sky’s blue, ‘cos the sun hit the water like ‘BING!'”
**Peterme:** “I’ve muted the bulk of my screen to better highlight the Sun, and I drew a red line that shows its course over a day.”
**Ghostface:** “The way the world look when you around; Prisoners get out, look up, run at you and then kiss the ground; You my favourite, I wish we had three more of you; I adore you, plus I even go to the store for you”
**Peterme:** “I keep the sun permanently above everything else, but with a lot of transparency so I can see through it to my other stuff. I love having this bit of the ‘real world’ impose itself over my electronic domain.”
**Ghostface:** “You make people eyes glow; You got the weather channel bugging and you stubborn when it snow.”

I think we can all agree, the Sun is a super star! Bonus points to anyone who can put Peter’s “I keep the sun permanently above everything else, but with a lot of transparency so I can see through it to my other stuff.” to a beat. It already sounds like something the Wu-Tang would say.
