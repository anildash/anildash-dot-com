The Village Voice’s [Best of New York 2004](http://www.villagevoice.com/bestof/2004/) is up, and it seems like the best one in years. People who haven’t worked in the publishing industry (or haven’t worked at the Voice) don’t necessarily know that “best of” issues are generally a chance for the editorial staff to phone it in. Inside jokes, lazy writing, and the triumph of the listicle, it’s everything I love in a paper that’s mainly funded by ads from whores. I say that because I love my Voice friends!

Also, lots of mentions of bloggers. That’s how you know the paper is good.
