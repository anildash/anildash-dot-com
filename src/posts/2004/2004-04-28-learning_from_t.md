Since so many people are still out there hunting for jobs in this tough economy, I would like to offer a bit of advice based on an unfortunate situation that I was lucky enough to not participate in firsthand:

Do *not* send your resume out to someone with "Track Changes" enabled. It just means your potential employer can actually watch your lies being written in front of them.
