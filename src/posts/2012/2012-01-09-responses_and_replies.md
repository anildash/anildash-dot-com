A few nice conversations around the web, either in response to or inspired by what I’ve been talking about here:

- My favorite TechCrunch post in a long time is Jon Evans’ [Scheming Intentions](http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/scheming-intentions/), which outlines a simple way that native mobile apps could take a tentative step towards re-integrating with the web.
- Shapeways, the delightful 3D printing-on-demand service wrote a [deep and thoughtful](http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/1147-Back-to-the-Future-3D-printing-and-the-rise-of-creative-commerce.html) response to my ideas about [where 3D printing is headed](http://dashes.com/anil/2011/12/3d-printing-teleporters-and-wishes.html). BoingBoing had a [quick take](http://boingboing.net/2011/12/21/3d-printers-as-teleporters.html) on the post, too, and I found the comments entertaining.
- I liked Michael Newman’s [recap of his favorites from 2011](http://zigzigger.blogspot.com/2011/12/faves-2011.html), especially his ruminations on animated .gifs.
- I had a blast talking to Leo Laporte and Tom Merritt on the Triangulation show — I know spending the better part of an hour listening to me ramble is a lot, but I’m very proud of the conversation about blogging in the first half, and hope that justifies enduring this for some folks:
