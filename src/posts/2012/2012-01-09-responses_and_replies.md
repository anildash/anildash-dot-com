A few nice conversations around the web, either in response to or inspired by what I’ve been talking about here:

- My favorite TechCrunch post in a long time is Jon Evans’ [Scheming Intentions](http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/scheming-intentions/), which outlines a simple way that native mobile apps could take a tentative step towards re-integrating with the web.
- Shapeways, the delightful 3D printing-on-demand service wrote a [deep and thoughtful](http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/1147-Back-to-the-Future-3D-printing-and-the-rise-of-creative-commerce.html) response to my ideas about [where 3D printing is headed](/2011/12/3d-printing-teleporters-and-wishes). BoingBoing had a [quick take](http://boingboing.net/2011/12/21/3d-printers-as-teleporters.html) on the post, too, and I found the comments entertaining.
- I liked Michael Newman’s [recap of his favorites from 2011](http://zigzigger.blogspot.com/2011/12/faves-2011.html), especially his ruminations on animated .gifs.
- I had a blast talking to Leo Laporte and Tom Merritt <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/35">on the Triangulation show</a> — I know spending the better part of an hour listening to me ramble is a lot, but I’m very proud of the conversation about blogging in the first half, and hope that justifies enduring this for some folks:

 * A wonderful, deep look at the [importance of owning your identity online](http://fixingthehobosuit.com/2012/01/own-yourself/), detailed by Patric King, uses the comments on my [recent post about Foursquare](/2012/01/03/foursquare-todays-best-executing-startup) in contrast to the comments on the piece was it was shared/republished on [Facebook](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-no-startup-is-better-than-foursquare-when-it-comes-to-new-products/#comment-400194186) and on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114042406/http://paidcontent.org/article/419-no-startup-is-better-than-foursquare-when-it-comes-to-new-products/#comment-400194186">PaidContent</a>
* I loved [Rebecca MacKinnon’s stirring TED talk](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/07/internet-freedom_n_1133513.html) asking people to take back the internet. Yes, let’s!  
* The fun app-as-nostalgia service [Timehop](http://timehop.com/) has been getting some attention; [Mashable’s piece](http://mashable.com/2011/12/19/timehop/) on the service uses my comments to demonstrate why it’s meaningful.  
* MetaFilter [revisits the principles of having a constructive community](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/21331/If-your-website-is-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault) and along the way re-legislates my advocacy around the idea that the site should do more to welcome new users.  
* Finally, an [interview I did for PBS’s “Need to Know”](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/video/fixing-government-anil-dash-on-a-social-media-revolution-for-policymakers/12575/) was <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/need-to-know-fixing-government-anil-dash-on-a-social-media-revolution/">excerpted on their site</a>; I think this brief clip highlights very well the challenge and opportunity that we see at Expert Labs to really have a positive impact on government. I don’t know if and when this airs in various locales, but hopefully this gives you a feel for the ideas.
