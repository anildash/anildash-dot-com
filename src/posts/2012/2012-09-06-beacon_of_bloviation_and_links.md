Oh, there’s been lots of chatter on the Internet this week! Where all did our conversations show up? Well, I’ll tell you.

* Pegged to the release of Jessica Valenti’s new book [Why Have Kids](http://jessicavalenti.com/books/why-have-kids/), I (somewhat inexplicably!) participated in an NY Daily News [Roundtable via Google Hangout](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/kids-join-daily-news-a-google-hangout-author-jessica-valenti-truth-parenting-happiness-article-1.1151319), discussing the vagaries of parenthood and career with Jessica, Lenore Skenazy and Karen “Duff” Duffy. You know you’d like to watch my first time interacting with the former VJ, right?
* Over on MetaFilter, [Larry Roberts wrote about Privately-Owned Public Spaces](http://www.metafilter.com/119525/Privately-Owned-Public-Spaces), a topic we just visited [a few months ago](/2012/03/05/captive-atria-and-living-in-public). I like the breadth of the resources he wrapped up in the discussion.  
* I was a judge for the Online News Association’s [Online Journalism Awards](http://journalists.org/2012/08/29/2012-online-journalism-awards-finalists-announced/) this year. The slate of entrants was extraordinary, and the selected honorees even more so. Do go check them out.  
* How the hell did Reddit manage to grow and thrive after being left for dead by the Diggosphere and snapped up by Condé Nast? [David Carr explored that topic](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/business/media/reddit-thrives-after-advance-publications-let-it-sink-or-swim.html?_r=1&emc=tnt&tntemail0=y) in the New York Times, and naturally I couldn’t shut up about it.  
* Our beloved animated gifs are a central part of fan culture. (Indeed, where would LiveJournal or Tumblr fanfic be without them?) and [Charles Kenny has the story](http://animationanomaly.com/2012/08/31/the-place-of-gifs-in-the-animated-fandom/#.UEWAZaSOqFd). I read the fanfic for the articles.  
* We reached our $5000 goal (and then some!) for the [charity: water campaign](http://mycharitywater.org/p/campaign/?campaign_id=30080) I launched yesterday. Not only did we top $5000 in a little over 12 hours, we’ve [vaulted to the top of the list](http://www.charitywater.org/september/) of campaigns as ranked by number of donors. Won’t you [give $37](https://mycharitywater.org/p/donate?campaign_id=30080&payment_amt=37#cc1) and become one, too?  

That’s all for now! Let me know if I’ve missed any of my blabbing elsewhere; I wouldn’t want to deprive you.
