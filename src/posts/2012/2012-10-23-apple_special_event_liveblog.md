Just getting ready to liveblog this event. My first Apple liveblog ever. Pretty excited.

Tim Cook begins by saying that Apple sold out of iPhone 5. But we all know the truth, which is that Apple sold out the day Woz left.

When we announced the new, super-thin iPod touch, we were so excited to see the Verge say, “We rubbed the iPod Touch on ourselves until the loop button popped up.”

There are now over 125 million documents stored on iCloud, and nearly 70 million of them are accessible at any given time.

We have over 28,000 messages being sent *every second* on iMessage, with nearly 44,000 iMessages being received over the next 4 to 6 weeks.

Apple is incredibly proud to have pioneered the TABLET CAMERA, which you can see in action in [this image](http://live.gdgt.com/live-ipad-mini-launch-event-coverage/#10-03-16-am) from our video.

Now to iBooks. In iBooks 3.0, we’re adding new themes, and support for four different weights of Marker Felt for your reading comfort, and we’ve made the pages kind of krinkly, and there’s a krinkly sound effect.

iBooks is extremely popular in grade schools, so we’re adding a new mode that automatically replaces π with 3 in order to comply with Texas schoolbook laws. Apple Maps shows the Earth as being flat, centered on the United States and wildly inaccurate, and thus is already compliant with Texas educational law.

Back in January, we released iBooks Author, which you might know as iDVD but for books. The big news is that iBooks has now replaced PowerPoint as the most popular platform for creating Macromedia-Shockwave-1997-level teaching materials that nobody reads.

Today we announce the newest version of iBooks Author. To the six templates built in to iBooks Author, we’ve added two more, one which comes with the name of your favorite rock band already carved into the cover, and the other looks like it’s covered in a book cover that you made out of a grocery bag.

We took a look at what’s available on the market today in the 7” tablet market. They’re mostly Android tablets, and they’re really weak in terms of battery life. More troubling, they have a devastating impact on their users’ self esteem.

Our new iPad Mini Smart Covers give us a new take on a classic Apple theme: They’re lickable. By which we mean, they’re actually flavored.

We know lots of folks get squicked out by chewing noises, so you can turn off the moist mastication music that plays while people lick your smart cover. But it’s on by default.
