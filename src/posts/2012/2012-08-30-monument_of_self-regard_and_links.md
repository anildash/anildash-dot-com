I sure do like talking to people! Here’s some recent conversations:

- MIT Tech Review offered up [A Twitter Tweak or a Revolution in Online Discourse?](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428924/a-twitter-tweak-or-a-revolution-in-online/) as a look at Branch. (Where, full disclosure, I’ve graduated from unofficial advisor to slightly-more-official advisor.) I have to reject the “Best Thing Ever or Completely Meaningless?” framing of the headline, but I liked the thoughtful understanding of the history of comments online that informed the piece.
- Oh, and speaking of Twitter (AS WE ALWAYS DO), here’s me on Bloomberg West talking about Twitter’s policy changes. TV is fun! (And Mathew Ingram [wrote a little bit more about it too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-20/hey-twitter-shouldnt-it-be-about-the-users))

- If you’re a regular reader of this site, you of course love animated gifs, since we’ve been [talking about them](/2011/07/animated-gifs-triumphant) for years. The Content Strategist (that’s a real publication!) jumps into the fray with [What the Rise of Animated GIFs Means for Content](http://contently.com/blog/2012/08/29/what-the-rise-of-animated-gifs-means-for-content/), a delightfully serious look at the editorial strategy around animated GIFs. A year ago we were discussing GIFs as ascendant, six years ago we discussed GIFs as having [finally been worthy of artistic recognition](/2006/07/zidane-world-cu) and a scant 23 years ago, they were just being invented. Progress!
- David Jacobs ruminates on [#NOFOMO](http://hello.typepad.com/hello/2012/08/nofomo.html). I’d shared some of the same misgivings about that phrasing, but the concept is useful.
- [Data on the country club](http://www.buzzfeed.com/benjaminj4/how-white-is-the-new-internet) from Benjamin Jackson over at Buzzfeed. I like it as a data-driven view into the ideas I was exploring [a few weeks ago](/2012/08/16/you-cant-start-the-revolution-from-the-country-club).
- Oh, and I had some fun talking to Microsoft’s Twitter account on they day they announced their new logo:

![Microsoft's Good Day](http://mlkshk.com/r/IR2D)

Aaaaand I think that’s it. You all keep on writing, and I’ll do the same, and we’ll meet back here in a little while.
