I donâ€™t usually agree to participate in corporate promo videos, but Microsoft asked me to talk broadly about why writing software is still inspiring to me after three decades of doing it, and I was happy to see them use it at their Build conference. Plus any video that segues from me to Bill Gates has to be a good one.
