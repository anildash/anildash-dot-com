The more I think about the “Making Of” documentary on the Phantom Menace DVD, the better I like it. A lot of critical decisions relating to the digital filming techniques used are captured very eloquently and succinctly. It seems to me that this would be like having film of the first electric guitars being built and played. Historical documentation of a paradigm shift. I am curious what parts are going to seem antiquated and quaint in a few years.
