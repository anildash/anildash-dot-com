Yes, all the talk today about Google and blogs is [about the launch of Blog Search](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2005/09/google_launches.html), but equally newsworthy to me is the [recent post about Dr. Lee](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/judge-clears-way-for-dr-lee.html) on Google’s official blog.

Straight from the handbook of “what not to blog about” on a company site comes a single post that discusses (1) a currently-pending lawsuit, (2) a judge’s decision in a case that hasn’t yet gone to trial, (3) a personnel issue regarding a current employee, and (4) their relationship with Microsoft, their biggest competitor. I guess the moral of the story is that it’s good to be a lawyer, but don’t try this one at home, kids. Congrats to Google for being *way* more open with their personal business than they are about their products.

I wonder if their intranet has a page that says “Google HR (Beta)”.
