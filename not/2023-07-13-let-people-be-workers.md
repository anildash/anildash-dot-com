There is a virtually infinite list of cultural oddities about the mainstream technology industry, but one of the most pervasive and peculiar is the habit of assigning a cutesy collective epithet to the workers at a particular organization.

The modern practice really took off in the early 2000s with the first wave of startups after the Dot Com bubble burst, most significantly Google's practice of calling its workers "Googlers" (and, after they left, "Xooglers"). It's a fairly understandable coinage, seeming almost inevitable after "google" became a common verb in vernacular language.

But, as with so many things in big tech, a practice that was fairly understandable and that began with a fairly benign or even boring origin, eventually mestastasized into a distorted and disturbing version of itself. The current habit is to create an odd and insular "branded" way of referring to workers, which companies resolutely treat as if they're charming and inclusive names for their colleagues, even in the face of seeing how obviously off-putting and creepy the behavior is when other companies do it. It seems to echo the corporate fealty of mid-20th-century culture, when the IBMs of the world used to have corporate anthems that employees were expected to earnestly embrace.

Google has Googlers, Amazon has Amazonians, and Meta tried to make fetch happen after rebranding from Facebook, by _dictating_ the new worker nickname to its staff, who now are, of course, the Meta... Metamates. Sure. Why not.

It gets even weirder and more uncomfortable when we get down to mid-sized companies, which don't even have the benefit of being household names like the tech giants are. Cisco's workers are Cisconians? Twilio has Twilions, Shopify has Shopifolk, and PagerDuty has Dutonians.
