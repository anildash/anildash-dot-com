I’ve been accused of a lot of things, but I’ve never been lambasted as [endearingly self-deprecatory](http://www.blogyou.com/a.html#anildash). I am quite unrepentantly proud of my completely unjstifiable, yet still formidable, ego, and I resent the implication that I’ve ever been guilty of humility of any sort. Let alone the basest sort of modesty, self deprecation. If having my name wrapped in

 isn’t indication enough that I’m toxically narcissistic, I don’t know what is.
I generally don’t have a high opinion of any rating system in general, but Blog You is apparently so factually off-base that a stylistic criticism would be heaping misery on the crippled.
