It popped up in conversation with [Matt](http://www.haughey.com), but I think a truly apt term for the Internet that we’re [mourning the death of](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/dystopia/) is the Unreasonable Web.

If you’ve ever seen the tagline that pops up at the top of this page sometimes, you’ll know that “You used to be able to get Free Stuff on the Internet”. I miss the Unreasonable Web.
