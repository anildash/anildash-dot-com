I pride myself on being a fan of many genres of music. In keeping with this, Iâ€™d like to recommend in the category of "Reggae by Jewish Guys from Jersey" the song "Zion" which you can download or stream [here](http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/140/ilan_friedman.html). And listen to that rhythm guitar!
