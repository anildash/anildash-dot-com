There’s a little [promotional page](http://enews.umpg.com/newpromo/) for Prince’s new live DVD up, and you can download some sound and video clips there. I’ll probably write up more of a review later, but in short the DVD, while entertaining, doesn’t really do justice to the live show it’s meant to document, and the recent live box set of CDs is probably a better choice if you’re looking for live Prince material.
