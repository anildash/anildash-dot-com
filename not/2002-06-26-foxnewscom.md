Quite possibly the best news I’ve heard in ages, and one that gives me hope for the eradication of an affront that has tormented me since I was in grade school. The Pledge of Allegiance had its “under god” clause [ruled unconstitutional](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,56310,00.html):

> “A profession that we are a nation ‘under God’ is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation ‘under Jesus,’ a nation ‘under Vishnu,’ a nation ‘under Zeus,’ or a nation ‘under no god,’ because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion,” Judge Alfred T. Goodwin wrote for the three-judge panel.
