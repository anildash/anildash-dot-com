I know I’ve linked to this site a million times before, but you are living a life less lively if you haven’t seen Sam’s beautiful, spare, elegant artwork at [Exploding Dog](http://www.explodingdog.com) recently. If you look at some of his older artwork with the more profound captions, and consider that it speaks to me more than almost any other visual art, you’ll get a more complete picture of who I am than you would by reading [about me](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?about.php) for hours.
