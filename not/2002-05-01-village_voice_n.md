I haven’t posted much because I’ve been busy building [this thing](http://www.villagevoice.com/nightguide/). As with most web projects, I see its going live not as a sign that it’s done, but that it’s finally past the halfway point, and that there are more parts finished than unfinished. Still a lot of work to do, but I’m happy with what’s there so far, because it’s better than what it’s replacing.
