Cool little thing for Microsoft Office 2000 users, the [Save My Settings Wizard](http://www.officeupdate.com/2000/downloadDetails/o2ksmsdd.htm), a little utility that **copies your personalizations and settings from one PC to another**, using MS servers.

**Sigh.** Wish I woulda had that when I was consulting in lots of different offices.
