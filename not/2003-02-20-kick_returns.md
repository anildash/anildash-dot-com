Well, it’s that time of year again, and late winter can only mean one thing: The impending return of the [KICK! kickball game](http://www.dashes.com/kick/), the unofficial start to the SXSW Interactive Festival’s activities.

Last year was the first year for the game, and the turnout was *astounding*. This year, though I’m a little late getting my butt in gear, I’ve had a lot of help from people who support the game, and the website has finally relaunched, with all the game details and lots of new things. New location! New logo! New merchandise! New time!

Do take a look, and if you’ll be in the Austin area (this isn’t an official SXSW event, so you don’t need to have registered for the conference) on March 8th, please do stop by. Even if you can’t make it, link to the site and let others know about the game where nobody ever gets picked last for their team.

Oh, and if you *are* registered for SXSW, stick around until Tuesday so you can attend the [panel](http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/panels/) I’m speaking on.
