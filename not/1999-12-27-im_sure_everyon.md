I’m sure everyone is going to link to *Time*‘s [Person of the Century](http://www.pathfinder.com/time/time100/poc/home.html) piece on Einstein, but let me add my own link.

And of course, **my two cents**. I think it’s a good choice, perhaps obvious, but that’s not their fault. The only quibble I have is that so much of the attention is being focused on the nuclear weapons aspect of his career, and so little on the fact that he was an American because of his departure from Hitler’s Germany.

And if we’ve got *Man on the Moon*, when is the Einstein biopic coming out? I’d watch that. Although I suppose it’d be hard to establish a story arc to Al’s life…
