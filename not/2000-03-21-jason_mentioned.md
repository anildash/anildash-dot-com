[Jason](http://www.kottke.org/) mentioned [Time Code](http://www.timecode2000.com/), and every time I hear about the screen-split-four-ways thing I can’t help but think about the camera [Judith](http://www.calamondin.com) had that took four photos on one frame of 35mm film.

Only I bet the cameras used to film the movie weren’t as colorful.

**Sigh.** I wish *I’d* gone to SXSW like Jason and Judith and all the other cool kids…
