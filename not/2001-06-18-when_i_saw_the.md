When I saw the TV ad for [Dancing Queens](http://www.dancingqueenscd.com/), featuring some ghastly, portly queens dancing (heaven forfend!) *poorly*, I assumed it had to be a parody.

“A 2CD set featuring 26 Drag Queen Classics!” sez the site. Funny, I thought all these songs were wedding reception staples now. Strange how there’s so much overlap in those two demographics.

Alternate category for this CD set? How ’bout “songs that can be used for the mandatory sing-along bonding sequence in bad Hollywood films”?
