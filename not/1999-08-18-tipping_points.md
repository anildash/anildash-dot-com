**A Guide to Gratuities**: While Iâ€™ve always been a generous tipper, (almost inappropriately so) I have definitely come under the sway of my **much more miserly** friends, to the point where I now find reasons to take deductions from the tip I was going to leave for the server. In order to warn anyone in the service industry, I have codified the transgressions that will result in fiduciary penalties. To wit:

Writing "Thanx" With an X on the check: **$2 off**

Dotting the "i" in their name with a heart (females): **$2 off**

Dotting the "i" in their name with a heart (males): **no tip**

Sneezing, coughing, expectorating in general: **$5 off**

Spilling water on me: **$5 off**

Spilling any *other* beverage on me: **no tip**

Spilling a beverage on another person in my party: **add $5**
