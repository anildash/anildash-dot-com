A lot of folks seemed to like the [Little Red Riding Hood video](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/03/this-is-how-we-should-talk-to-kids.html) I linked to the other day, so I thought I’d reach [way back into the archives](http://dashes.com/anil/2000/10/straight-outta.html) (anybody still hanging around who was reading this site in 2000?) and dig out an [old favorite](http://dashes.com/anil/2001/01/remember-a-few.html).

Behold, “Video Computer System” by Brazil’s own [Golden Shower](http://www.goldenshower.gs/). (Don’t blame me — I didn’t name the band.) One of the first chiptunes tracks to really take off online, the song was pretty good on its own merits, but was bolstered immeasurably by having a flawlessly-executed montage of Atari imagery as its accompanying video.

Delightfully, after nearly a decade, the original video is [still online](http://www.newvenue.com/archives/feature44/). It seems, though, that the quality of those old quicktimes clips is a little bit lower than what used to be downloadable from the site ages ago, so I’ve uploaded a higher-resolution copy of the video to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rKkpHLl1Ew) and embedded it here. The original [credits](http://www.goldenshower.gs/e/quemfez.html) for the film are still online, listing Carlos B�la, Guilherme Marcondes, Mateus de Paula Santos and Mario Sader as the creators of the clip, for which they won an MTV Brazil VMA for Best Electronica Video. There’s a special credit for Alfredo Hisa, who created the video’s signature moment, a Matrix homage that is all the more impressive when you remember that the film that was being referenced was only about a year old at the time.

Golden Shower also offers a pretty interesting [behind-the-scenes look](http://www.goldenshower.gs/e/makingof.html) at how the video was created. It’s worth a look just for the time capsule effect of seeing a bunch of old-school iMacs running OS 9 and now-vintage versions of applications. Most entertaining to me was the [still-extant blog](http://www.goldenshower.gs/e/novidades.html) that the team kept, listing mentions of the video across the web.

There’s something to be said for web content that holds up well, even almost a decade later.
