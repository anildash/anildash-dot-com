A few weeks ago, I [asked the people](http://twitter.com/anildash/status/1061421693) who follow [my Twitter account](http://twitter.com/anildash) to describe the difference between lemons and limes. My immediate prompt was because I was trying to explain that some languages use the same word for both citrus fruits, and others only have a word for one or the other, and thus are forced to use descriptors to distinguish between which one is being specified.

But the responses I got back ranged from charming to insightful, and all demonstrated just how strongly lemons and limes affect our senses. Here’s a sample of the responses from Twitter and Facebook.

The literalist:

- [baffled](http://twitter.com/baffled/statuses/1061492844): Easy: lemons are lemony and limes are more limey

The bitter-sweet battle:

- [ericagee](http://twitter.com/ericagee/statuses/1061451996): Limes are a little bit sweeter and a lot bit tarter :).
- [antichason](http://twitter.com/antichason/statuses/1061441666): lemons have a bitter undertone to the sour, while limes are sweeter. Which is why limeade will always be superior to lemonade.
- [choirshark](http://twitter.com/choirshark/statuses/1061435264): lemons vs. limes: lemons are rarely tasting bitter to me, lime do sometimes

The poets:

- [freshelectrons](http://twitter.com/freshelectrons/statuses/1061476197): limes have a little taste of moonlight and silver in with the sunshine / citrus aromatics
- [Wiley Wiggins](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=500012896&amp;ref=profile#minifeed_5280497780379723822): Lemons have a sweeter darker flavor, Limes are sharper and metallic, the sweetness is married closer to the acidity. The acid in lemons is fruitier.

A few charming responses:

- [gwentown](http://twitter.com/gwentown/statuses/1061530804): Easy: limes are better. [*I loved the blatantly opinionated response here.*]
- [danwolfgang](http://twitter.com/danwolfgang/statuses/1061518392): lemons are great for lemonade, limes are great for marinades. [*This sounded like Dorothy Parker to me.*]
- [otherniceman](http://twitter.com/otherniceman/statuses/1061508186): lemons }{, limes () [*Obviously nerdy, but still somehow clearly correct.*]

And then, those that were least literal and perhaps most evocative. These caught my eye because (at least as I read them) they seemed like totally unselfconscious responses based on how we perceive the taste and smell of these fruits.

- [redmonk](http://twitter.com/redmonk/statuses/1061444761): limes taste rounder.
- [JonathanDeamer](http://twitter.com/JonathanDeamer/statuses/1061432659): EASY. Limes taste more green.
- [Harold Check](http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=500012896&amp;ref=profile#minifeed_5280497780379723822): Lemons taste yellow. Limes taste green.

Thanks to everyone who responded. If you’re looking for a scientific distinctions between the two species, you can consult your favorite reference materials to learn about *Citrus aurantifolia* or *C. latifolia* (limes) and *Citrus limon* (lemons). A quick Google search for comparisons between the two fruit will yield a large number of people saying that limes are just unripened lemons. These people are stupid and should learn from the wisdom of the folks I’ve quoted above.
