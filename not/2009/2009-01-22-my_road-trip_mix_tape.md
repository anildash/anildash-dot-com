[On and On](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Janet+Jackson+On+and+On&amp;index=digital-music&amp;tag=plinky09-20) by [Janet Jackson](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Janet+Jackson&amp;index=digital-music&amp;tag=plinky09-20)

It's literally a song about cruising down the road with the top down.

It's about reincarnating as a dolphin, which is what I do on the road.

I remember when I first got this album, visiting my parents and going to pick up my then-girlfriend, now-wife at the airport so she could meet the folks for the first time, and being excited and a little nervous and just rocking out with this song blasting out of the windows of the rental car.
