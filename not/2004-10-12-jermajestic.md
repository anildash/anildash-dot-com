Things are, as always, just fine in the Jackson family. For example, Jermaine has a young son, Jermajesty. As in Jermaine + Majesty. Because that’s a name that’s more “majestic” than Michael [naming a few of his kids Prince](http://dashes.com/anil/2002/08/the-once-and-fu.html). And Jermajesty’s mother? Why, she’s Alejandra Genevieve Oaziaza, whom we first knew as *Randy* Jackson’s wife.

Thus: “Hi, my name is Jermajesty Jackson. I’m my own ex-cousin.”

[Update, 2014: Jermajesty’s parents split up and their marriage was nullified because Alejandra had actually already been married to someone else the whole time.]
