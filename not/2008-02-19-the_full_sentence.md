From [this New York Times story on proper use of a semicolon](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/nyregion/18semicolon.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin) in subway signage:

> David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam serial killer who taunted police and the press with rambling handwritten notes, was, as the columnist Jimmy Breslin wrote, the only murderer he ever encountered who could wield a semicolon just as well as a revolver. (Mr. Berkowitz, by the way, is now serving an even longer sentence.)

Part of me thinks Sam Roberts wrote the entire story just to get that last line in. I know I would.
