You know I don’t like awards much, but I do like when my friends are recognized. And since lots of them are nominated, go vote for ’em at the Bloggies. Or, more formally, the [Second Annual Weblog Awards](http://www.fairvue.com/awards2002/).

Toughest call for me was lifetime achievement. I just passed on that one.
