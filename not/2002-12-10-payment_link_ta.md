There are already a lot of defined (if not quite standardized) [possible values](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-links) for the [LINK element](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.3) in XHTML. We’re using them for [RSS Auto-Discovery](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/31.html) and, of course, for stylesheets already. But what about something like:

`<link rel="appendix" type="text/html" title="payment" href="<em>URL of Wishlist or Paypal Page</em>" />`

A standardized way of linking to the page where you pay for your patronage of a site. Granted, calling the payment page an "Apppendix" of the site you’re visiting is fudging things a bit. Maybe there’s a more elegant way?
