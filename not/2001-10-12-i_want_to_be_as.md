I want to be as cool as this guy: [Jonathan Brown made a robot that can solve a Rubik’s Cube](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/11/technology/circuits/11RUBI.html?rd=hcmcp?p=0418P80418OI4M8mM012000mRKGoRKSC). Sometimes I describe myself as a geek. Then I see a guy like this, and I know I’m just a dabbler. But it’s okay, I probably dress better than him.
