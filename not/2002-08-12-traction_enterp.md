The wily folks at [Traction](http://www.tractionsoftware.com/) have positioned their new enterprise content management system as weblog software. Iâ€™m a strong believer that weblogs are a natural format for knowledge management, especially within the firewall, but this just seems to be a regular CMS with minimal blogging features masquerading as a weblog platform.

> Traction is a leader in next generation Enterprise Weblog software, delivering interoperable, inexpensive, rapidly deployable, open and easy to use tools for groups and teams to communicate, share, organize and link business information in context.
