It’s really weird that after years of kicking around the industry [Lewis Taylor](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000AMWJ0M/ref=2020-20) finally shows up, apparently charting in some places. It’s even been enough that I finally signed up for MySpace so I could follow what’s going on there…

The record is his old one, Stoned, though I guess it just finally got U.S. distribution. Curious to see if there’s any audience for this, which would confirm my hypothesis that audiences other than VH1 viewers at 3 in the morning are ready for neo-soul, just as long as it’s presented by a British guy. I dunno what it says about demographics that I don’t see any of his stuff on the preferred music stealing service. I must be getting old.
