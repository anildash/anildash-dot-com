I’d intended to post a correction to [this NY Times story’s recounting](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/fashion/02blog.html?ref=style) of the history of blog book tours, but was pleased to see that my friend, and intermittent blogger, Jason Kottke has [already done the legwork](http://www.kottke.org/07/09/virtual-book-tours-the-origins-of).

For my part, here’s [Greg Knauss’ post on my blog](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/04/knauss.html) from his seminal tour for *[Rainy Day Fun And Games For Toddler And Total Bastard](http://www.sonewpublishing.com/stacks/knauss/)*. (Which book I still heartily recommend, by the way.)

And then two years later, I hosted Danyel Smith for a [quick](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/04/um-hello.html)[stop](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/04/brooklyn-pretty.html) as she promoted *[More Like Wrestling](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400046440/2020-20/)*. Since then, Danyel’s gone on to [return as Editor in Chief](http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a8912.asp) of [Vibe](http://www.vibe.com/). Sure, it’s a role she’s uniquely qualified for, but I like to think that having a brief stopover at my blog on her book tour was really what sealed the deal.
