Congratulations to two of the finest people I know for the announcement that they’re [reproducing](http://tenyearsofmylife.com/2004/12/06/). We need more like the Haugheys, so it’s good that they’re increasing the planet’s Haughey count. I only worry about a child who is likely to be the biggest geek ever in the history of the universe.
