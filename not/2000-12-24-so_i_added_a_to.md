So, I added a "[To Go](mobile.php)" link on the right there, you can see a bare-bones version of this page which is suitable for PDA’s, etc. (Actually, I quite like it, maybe it’ll become my regular design.) Since most people on Palms or PocketPC’s use AvantGo to sync up those sorts of things, you can also [click here to add an AvantGo channel](http://avantgo.com/mydevice/autoadd.html?title=anil%20dash&amp;url=http://www.dashes.com/anil/mobile.php&amp;max=100&amp;depth=1&amp;images=1&amp;links=0&amp;refresh=hourly&amp;hours=1&amp;dflags=127&amp;hour=0&amp;quarter=00&amp;s=00) to your subscriptions list.
