Toward the end of every year, as people are thinking of making donations to charities either as an act of goodwill, or to help reduce their tax burden, or both, I try to work with my online networks to help out causes I believe in. And every year, Iâ€™m blown away by the generosity and creativity of the people Iâ€™m connected to.

2014 was no exception in this regard. First, we tried to help [Family Care International](http://www.familycareintl.org/en/home), which fights for reproductive health and education around the world. The response was extraordinary.

> Okay, here's what we're doing. For the next hour, you donate to [@familycareintl](https://twitter.com/familycareintl) & I'll match you. GO! [https://t.co/PqXO3fI3nq](https://t.co/PqXO3fI3nq)

> In just *one hour* we managed to raise $1175 for [@familycareintl](https://twitter.com/familycareintl)! We'll round up to $1200 and double it. That's $2400 in 60 minutes. ðŸ™‚

As amazing as that was, it didnâ€™t prepare me for what was next. We set out to support [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/), and provide resources for schools and teachers in need.

> Alright, let's do this! For the next hour, give to a [@DonorsChoose](https://twitter.com/DonorsChoose) project, tell me what you gave & I'll match it: [http://t.co/cwzhEiaHJb](http://t.co/cwzhEiaHJb)

And my incredible network of friends astounded me.

> What we can do together: In one hour, we teamed up and raised $7905 for [@DonorsChoose](https://twitter.com/DonorsChoose). Thank you, and thanks to everyone who teaches!

I donâ€™t ever take for granted that Iâ€™ve been given an incredible platform on these various social networks, and I thank everybody whoâ€™s inspired me by trying to give back using these ridiculous little technological tools.

> So the end of the year seems like as good a time as any to say thank you. I appreciate that you all spend some time/attention with me here.
