Over at [Disturbing Search Requests](http://searchrequests.weblogs.com/2001/02/20), [Dan](http://www.lakefx.nu) blogged requests for “Anil sex photos” which I actually get a lot of. In fact, I could have my own subsite on DSR for "Anil sex" in general.

[Peter](http://www.peterme.com) and [Judith](http://www.calamondin.com) once suggested that I change my site’s name to Anil Sex because it doesn’t actually have a name of its own.

Um, I don’t think I’m going to do that. I hate people who can’t spell.
