Prince’s *S.S.T.*, his (surprisingly good) Hurricane Katrina relief track is now up on the [iTunes Music Store](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?s=143441&amp;playListId=80320643). Nice that you don’t have to be in his little online store to download it, and the song’s worth listening to, anyway. The really weird part is that it’s kind of a tribute to Sade’s *Sweetest Taboo*, continuing Prince’s recent trend of writing his own songs about other people’s songs.
