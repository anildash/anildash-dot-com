There are a million reasons to post the video for Cameo's "Word Up", but today I am sharing this with you because it features LeVar Burton Gettin' Funky!

[![Cameo - Word Up](http://a3.vox.com/6a00b8ea067a51dece00e398ce42ab0004-500pi "Cameo - Word Up")](http://anil.vox.com/library/video/6a00b8ea067a51dece00e398ce42ab0004.html)

LeVar is looking like a long-lost member of the Time, and you don't need a VISOR to know that's a sharp look! YES I DID JUST MAKE A [VISOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VISOR) JOKE.

If you want to undo the extreme funkiness of this clip (Larry's sportin' the big red codpiece!) then you can inflict the [Ko?n cover of this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq5DNLyzwfU) upon yourself. It's of the same quality you've come to expect from everything that Ko?ndoes! That's a nice way of saying they suck! Even Limp Bizkit is the fault of Ko?n, right down to the deliberate spelling error! That's dumber than the [heavy metal umlaut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut)! There's a [film](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/umlaut.html) about heavy metal umlaut's wikipedia entry! I can't stop shouting about this awful band! I wish I were a wolf so I could gnaw off my own paw![](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq5DNLyzwfU)
