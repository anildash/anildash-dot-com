I don’t know exactly what the significance of this realization is to me, but I thought I’d share. The [debate between Robert Scoble and Dave Winer](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116490323676636989-HnHPKLzkyy9xKy2wnokbd2bc_bE_20071130.html?mod=blogs) about Microsoft and innovation, on the Wall Street Journal’s website, is the best thing I think I’ve seen either of them write.

I’ve read a few of Dave’s older long-form essays, but I’ve never seen Robert write anything of this length. (Or, perhaps, of this degree of focus.) And I don’t actually read their blogs directly — I find that links from, and discussion of, their sites leads me to reading the blogs of these two fellows pretty frequently without having to seek them out. For what it’s worth, I’d definitely subscribe to their sites if this were the kind of content they regularly published. The quality of the debate stands out in comparison to [the underwhelming discussion](http://forums.wsj.com/viewtopic.php?t=122) it’s inspired so far.

And for what it’s worth, I agree with the points that both of them make about Microsoft, too.
