So, if you read my site and you’re using Internet Explorer on Windows, you’ve got to have the [Google Toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com), right? (If you don’t, don’t tell me, I got no love for you.) Well, if you have it, you can try [the beta version of the updated toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/go?version=beta&amp;hl=en), which adds Google Image search and some voting buttons with which you can rate pages either positively or negatively.

I am guessing that it’ll lead to some future collaborative filtering system courtesy of Google, but since I don’t know where it’ll lead yet, I am just excited over the possibilites.

Also, if you view source on the “Toolbar Options…” screen of the beta version, you can see that there are two checkboxes that are commented out, one for “All-in-One Search”, which just adds a drop-down search button to your Toolbar, allowing you to specify specific Google searches for your terms, such as the [Linux](http://google.com/linux) search or the [U.S. Government](http://google.com/unclesam) search. You can enable it by going to your Toolbar Options page and then navigating to [http://toolbar.google.com/command?FancySearch=true](http://toolbar.google.com/command?FancySearch=true).

The other option that’s commented out allows you to redirect searches on the IE Address bar to Google instead of the default MSN search. This one can be enabled by going to [http://toolbar.google.com/command?Preempt=true](http://toolbar.google.com/command?Preempt=true) from your Toolbar Options page, but it doesn’t seem to be working yet.

**Google is my best friend.**
