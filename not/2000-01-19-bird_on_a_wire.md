[Bird on a wire](http://students.washington.edu/lwinn/bird/) asks, "Priceline now lets you name your own price for groceries. Will people really put up with the hassle?" and I say: **Hell, yeah!**.

I’m certainly not the coupon-clipping type, (I’d rather throw money at a problem than throw effort at it…) but Priceline really does save you a bundle. And I’m not just saying that to suck up to Bill Shatner.
