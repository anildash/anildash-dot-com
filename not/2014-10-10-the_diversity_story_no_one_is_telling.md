In my [my latest piece for Medium](https://medium.com/message/the-tech-diversity-story-thats-not-being-told-9a36fb40530f), I wrote about an issue that’s been bugging me for a long time: Asian American men in tech don’t do enough to speak up about inclusion in our industry.

Honestly, I think our sexism and our racism against fellow people of color are huge factors. And of course there’s our own often-overlooked sense of cultural insecurity, the fear that all the progress and advances we’ve made are so fragile, so tenuous, that if we speak up in defense of others, we might be pushed back to the margins again ourselves.

But we have power. We have a voice. It’s well past time we show our strength.
