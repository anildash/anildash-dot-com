This is a [puzzle](http://www.picture.com/puzzle.asp?ID=194867&amp;level=easy) based on a photo Helen took when she was studying in Greece. While itâ€™s pretty **easy to solve**, it is fun to work with.

**Note**: This is *not* a sliding-tile puzzle, you merely click on the pieces if you want to exchange their positions.
