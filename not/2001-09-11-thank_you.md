Thank you so much to all of you who have messaged, emailed and called. (Or tried to.) I am physically fine, as are all my family members and immediate friends. I’ve been watching the footage all morning, I can’t believe I watched the World Trade Center collapse… for those of you unfamiliar with New York, somewhere around 50,000 people or more work at the WTC Towers. I’ve been hearing sirens all day, although I live well north of the scene of the catastrophe, halfway up the island of Manhattan.

I’ve been sitting here this whole morning, choking back tears… this is just *too* much, too big. I can see the smoke and ash from the street here. I have friends of friends who work there, I was just there myself the day before yesterday. I can’t process this all. I don’t want to.
