Maybe it’s just the sentimentality that comes from knowing I’ll be away from New York City for a few weeks, but there’s still something undeniably magical about it…

Tonight was a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge right as the sun set, a typically fantastic dinner at [Grimaldi’s](http://www.grimaldis.com/), a quickly-grabbed pint from the [Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory](http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/12037820) before a jaunt on the [water taxi](http://www.nywatertaxi.com/), and stepping off the boat at 34th Street, just a few blocks over from the Empire State Building.

I never mean to take it all for granted, but every time I think I’ve started to forget, I find myself falling back in love.
