Just like [last year](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/03/09/to_keep_you_bus) and the [year before](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2000/03/10/a_panda_walks_i), it’s time for the panda joke:

A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders a sandwich. He eats

the sandwich, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. As the panda stands

up to go, the manager shouts, “Hey! Where are you going? You just shot my

waiter, and you didn’t even pay for your sandwich!”

“Hey, man, I’m a *PANDA*!” the panda shouts back. “Look it up!”

The manager opens his dictionary and reads:

> **Panda:** A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterized by distinct black and white coloring. Eats shoots and
> 
> leaves.
