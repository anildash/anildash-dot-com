I said on September 15, 1999, that you could "[expect tons of Anil-related content to unveil itself here shortlyâ€¦](http://www.dashes.com/anil/091599.html)" and I added the link to my [about page](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?about.php) up there on the toolbar **last week**.

In my world, that counts as "shortly".
