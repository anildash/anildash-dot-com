Dan already blogged my feelings on one of the [screenshots pictures](http://www.wwa.com/~dhartung/weblog/):

> The isometric view form has become so common in gaming that this is a terrific way to question both the way it affects the way we see things, as well as the way in which dramatic events are portrayed in the media as entertainment. There’s one thing wrong here, though: the photographer isn’t part of the scene. Why not? What does it say that the viewpoint we’re most familiar with is erased?

Bothered me a lot too that the photographer was gone from these photos, especially the Elian one.
