It’s time to revisit this [suggestion from 1996](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/1996JulDec/0036.html). I’ve been saying for years that the <[link](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.3)> tag will be the savior of the web, and the proposal (labelled "[Experience 2](http://dftuz.unizar.es/wwwlab/links.html)") would let us store our inbound link referrals (like the "Froms" on this page) in the metadata of the page header. That would let us map out relationships between sites, or enable meme-based navigation, or some other wacky functionality that I can’t quite figure out yet.
