So, Prince is playing the Fillmore in San Francisco this weekend, two shows, and I need tickets. His online music club is supposed to hook us fans up, but I missed out on the window for buying tickets and now I am sad. Since I can’t be home in New York this weekend, at least help me endure the Bay Area’s lack of culture while I’m here, won’tcha? You can get me at [anil@dashes.com](mailto:anil@dashes.com).
