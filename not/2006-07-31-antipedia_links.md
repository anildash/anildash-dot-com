The community of people who criticize Wikipedia form an [interesting culture](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/31/antipedia), as I noted earlier. If you want the links to do the research yourself, here’s some places to start.

- The Onion, “[Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years Of American Independence](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/50902)“: The first Onion piece that’s actually made me LOL in years. “Did Betsy Ross, as legend has it, really have the biggest boobies in the New World?”
- [ASCII: Jason Scott’s weblog](http://ascii.textfiles.com/). Jason’s done some amazing work with his [BBS Documentary](http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/), his [collection of text files](http://www.textfiles.com/), and he wrote a great post explaining [why his documentary is Creative Commons-licensed](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/000123.html), complete with a [followup](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/000170.html). But that’s not why I mention him…
- Jason Scott’s also written the [most definitive critique of Wikipedia policy](http://www.archive.org/details/20060408-jscott-wikipedia), here hosted by the Internet Archive.
- I mentioned Stacy Schiff’s [New Yorker article on Wikipedia](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060731fa_fact), but this week’s New Yorker features [an article on the rise of amateurs](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060807fa_fact1) that’s really just a gloss on the [most recent Pew Report on blogging](http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/186/report_display.asp). Apparently, most people want to [use communication tools to communicate](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/26/digga_please), but a few want to do journalism or make money.
- Finally ,[Ikkyu2’s Wikipedia user page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ikkyu2), complete with a list of [what’s wrong with Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ikkyu2#What.27s_wrong_with_Wikipedia). See also [LiveJournal](http://ikkyu2.livejournal.com/) and [a phenomenal history of Ask MetaFilter answers](http://ask.metafilter.com/search_comments.mefi?user_ID=17548).
