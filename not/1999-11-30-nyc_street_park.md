On a much lighter note, anyone who’s lived in, or spent appreciable time in, New York City, is familiar with the vagaries of [alternate side of the street](http://www.yale.edu/yup/ENYC/alternate_side.html) parking rules. However, it’s damned near impossible to find out about these regulations online.

Before its merger with [CityGuide](http://www.cityguide.com), [MSN](http://www.msn.com)‘s [Sidewalk](http://www.sidewalk.com) used to have a page of [Parking Tips](http://newyork.sidewalk.com/link/41038) (now dead). Now, the sites are combined and the forwarding page is useless.

With much effort, I found the [parking calendar](http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/dot/html/travroad/scrintro.html) on the [City of New York](http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/)‘s rather poorly-organized website.

Seems to me there is a crying need for a simple **map of Manhattan** with clickable links indicating the appropriate parking rules for whatever neighborhood you’ve selected. There are **4 million** or more cars in Manhattan on a typical day– ain’t that a big enough market for someone to go after?
