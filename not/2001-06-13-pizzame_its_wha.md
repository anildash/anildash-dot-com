(It’s what [these pages](http://www.peterme.com/browsed/browsed090899.html) used to look like.) As [Jesse](http://www.jjg.net) correctly guessed, this site was discovered in the pursuit of a [photo](http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/MeFiPi.jpg) that could be used to mock our resident [Rock Star](http://www.haughey.com)‘s [latest media appearance](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/13/technology/13WANG.html).
