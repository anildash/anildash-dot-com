Sam Brown (of Exploding Dog fame) has just released his new book, [amazing rain](http://www.amazingrain.org/), and it looks to be something beautiful. I have his book “New Job”, and judging by the story he was able to tell in just 18 pages there, one 120 page story should be amazing. Might make a good gift for someone on your holiday list. Sam’s selling signed copies at the link above for $30, and you can [buy it from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=2020-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F1932360506) as well.
