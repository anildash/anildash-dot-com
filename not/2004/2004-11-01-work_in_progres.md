I’ll be making more changes soon, but at least there’s finally something up and running on my new server. If you’re seeing this, of course, the DNS has already propagated to you. People who aren’t so fortunate can visit me at [http://209.197.68.184/anil/](http://209.197.68.184/anil/).

(And don’t fret too much about the giant ads, I’m just trying out different stuff and I think they’ll probably go away soon. The $7 a month isn’t really worth hiding all the content for.)
