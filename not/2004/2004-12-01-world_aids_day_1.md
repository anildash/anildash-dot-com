Today is [World AIDS Day](http://www.worldaidsday.org/). It seems that [Link and Think](http://www.linkandthink.org/) isn’t active this year, but the blog community has a [long](http://www.metafilter.com/dww.cfm)[history](http://www.metafilter.com/linkandthink.mefi) of [observing](http://www.metafilter.com/linkandthink2002.mefi) the day. Do take some time to go back and look at the links that have been shared in the past, and if you’ve got links to share, you can [contribute your own](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/37370).

If you’re unsure of your own status, [get tested](http://www.knowhivaids.org/). And if you don’t know enough about the disease, you can learn more about its spread [throughout the world](http://www.unaids.org/en/default.asp). Though its necessity is lamentable, there’s even a [Kids’ AIDS site](http://www.thekidsaidssite.com/), if you need to educate the young ones in your life.
