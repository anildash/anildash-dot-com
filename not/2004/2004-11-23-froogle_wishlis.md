Hmm, one of those things that you knew they were going to get around to eventually: [Froogle Wishlists](http://froogle.google.com/shoppinglist/). I think there were about 35 really bad dot-coms that were trying to make generic web-wide wishlists back during the bubble (I think I still have an I’ve Been Good t-shirt around somewhere) but ecommerce was still probably too young and immature to support the idea back then. Plus, Google’s got fairly good distribution.

On the other hand, aren’t Froogle’s results still kinda sucky and ugly? Is it just me?
