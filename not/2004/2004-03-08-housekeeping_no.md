[Steven’s lament](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/movabletype/archives/000153.html) is particularly timely for me… If you’ve been waiting on an email from me at any time since Friday night, my apologies, as I’ve been having trouble sending mail out.

The good thing is, I used my partial unplugging from the net to get started reading [Mind Wide Open](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743241657/) and I’m loving it already. It feels like an O’Reilly "Brain Hacks" book.

On another housekeeping note, my comment preview pages are a little screwy, but my individual archive pages for weblog posts should be considerably less ugly than they were. Cobblers’ children, they say, always have the shoddiest shoes.
