Jeff’s been [doing some more thinking](http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_12_02.html#008584) about how to protect bloggers from frivilous lawsuits from corporations. (Where are the tort reform extremists when it’s corporations that are abusing the legal system?) I don’t know if I agree 100% with his suggestion, but I like the motivation behind it and the attempt at creating a solution.
