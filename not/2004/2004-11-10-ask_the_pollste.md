I know lots of people, on both sides of the fence, think the divergence between exit poll data and actual voting results is curious, especially given the shoddy software that runs a lot of electronic voting booths.

That being the case, I’m surprised more people haven’t just [asked the exit pollers themselves](http://www.edisonresearch.com/home/archives/2004/11/view_election_2.html) to explain the discrepancy. I’m sure they’d be glad to give some insights on the matter.
