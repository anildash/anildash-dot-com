Jason says my blog is [almost as good as his](http://www.kottke.org/04/12/favorite-weblogs-2004). I agree! Also, check out all the good sites he mentions. It’s quite telling that Jason’s done a [best links of 2004](http://www.kottke.org/04/12/best-links-2004) post, while none of the traditional media has been savvy enough to do anything more specific than the tried-and-true “our favorite web sites of the year” stories. Real reporting on the web would happen as a much more granular level.

I should mention that I think I’ve been doing some of my best blogging over on the [Professional Network](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/) weblog. If you like the blog-related links, you should check out that site. I update there more often than I do here.
