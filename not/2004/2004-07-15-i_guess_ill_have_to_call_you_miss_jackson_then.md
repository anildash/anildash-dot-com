The sad truth is that I am the only person in this airport lounge right now who’s *really* enjoying Janet Jackson’s *[Nasty](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RZPQ/2020-20)*. Part of it is because these people around me are boring. The other part of the reason is because I read this [amazing history of MPLS funk](http://citypages.com/databank/25/1232/article12300.asp) in City Pages today and it led me to Peter Scholtes’ [Complicated Fun](http://babelogue.citypages.com:8080/pscholtes/) blog, where he’s got some amazing early pictures of Grand Central, Flyte Tyme, and others.
