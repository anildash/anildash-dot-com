In answer to Mena’s question regarding Movable Type, asking "[How are you using the tool?](http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/how_are_you_usi.shtml)", I thought I’d explain a little bit about my personal setup.

I have six weblogs, one of which is inactive because I used to use it to keep track of my Peeves of the Moment (any old-school readers remember those?) but it hasn’t been touched in a long time.

In addition to that, I’ve got my mothballed [magazine](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/), the [KICK!](http://www.dashes.com/kick/) blog for the kickball game, and the [Kevin Sites mentions](http://www.dashes.com/kevinsites/) blog which I set up last year.

And of course, I’ve got [my main weblog](http://www.dashes.com/anil) and the [Daily Links](http://www.dashes.com/links), which also appear on the sidebar of the main blog. I actually have three or four others, which you can find at [anildash.com](http://www.anildash.com/), but those are TypePad sites.

Now, for authors, I have two logins for myself, though I don’t remember why. Then I have two guest logins for people like Xeni who are allowed to update the Kevin Sites blog. I have a login for my sister, though she’s never really blogged, and I have another author account I made for Danyel when she posted [last month](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/04/21/brooklyn_pretty).

In total, six weblogs, five of them active, and six authors, only two of them active in the last 90 days. I’ll be upgrading to MT3, since I want the comment management features, the Atom support, and I like the new UI. The Personal Edition license covers what I’m doing.
