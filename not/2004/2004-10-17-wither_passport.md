Microsoft hasn’t talked much about [Passport](http://www.passport.net/Consumer/default.asp?lc=1033) lately, but Monster.com sent out an email last week saying that they were discontinuing the option to sign in using Passport. And I noticed today that eBay isn’t offering the option to sign in with Passport anymore either. Although the creepy [Passport for Kids](http://kids.passport.net/) site is still up and running, and the notice from last March about [the Express Purchase service getting killed](http://www.passport.net/Consumer/WalletLetter.asp?lc=1033) is still up, but I think the definitive bad sign is that [the directory of sites using Passport](http://www.passport.net/Directory/Default.asp?PPDir=C&amp;lc=1033) is gone.

Was there some press release from Microsoft about Passport dying? Did I miss it?
