As the wags are fond of saying, and Flickr is fond of demonstrating, social networking is a *feature*, not an application. Thus, [Netflix Friends](http://www.netflix.com/FriendsLearnMore). Thatâ€™s actually pretty useful. Thanks to [Hacking Netflix](http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/2004/12/netflix_launche.html) for the link.
