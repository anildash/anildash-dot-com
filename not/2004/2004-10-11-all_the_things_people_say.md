…controversy. Seems like Prince’s attempt to promote the new record with a predictably-controversial video is working, since even Billboard is picking up the [AP story on the Cinnamon Girl video](http://www.billboard.com/bb/daily/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000663705). The recurrent press on this in New Zealand leads me to believe Keisha Knight-Pulliam Castle-Hughes is the biggest star on that tiny island.

Too bad the song still mostly sucks.
