When I used to work in music promotion, we talked a lot about pre-loading PCs or other devices with music videos and songs. Sippey [did the best job of describing it](http://www.theobvious.com/new/2003.07.28.html), and now the [Mac rumor sites](http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0410briefly.html) are saying that Appleâ€™s going to announce a U2 preload next month.
