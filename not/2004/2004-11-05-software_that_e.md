A young up-and-coming researcher named Clay Shirky has just published [Flaming and the Design of Social Software](http://shirky.com/writings/group_user.html), which I think is useful in that it talks about the role software has in creating the culture of a community. In the context of Tom discovering [Movable Type made his posts longer and less frequent](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2004/11/five_years_of_plasticbagorg_the_visualisations.shtml) (better thought out?) and Nick talking about [the social responsibilities of developing software](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/ramblings_on_go.html), it seems like weâ€™re in the midst of a full-fledged bout of geek self-examination. Hooray!
