I made a bunch of improvements to my [Daily Links](http://www.dashes.com/links/), with more on the way. The blog is [AtomEnabled](http://www.dashes.com/links/atom.xml), the layout and font size are improved, the explanatory text that’s hidden until you hover over the links is now visible, you can load the links into your browser’s sidebar on Internet Explorer or Firebird for easier clicking, and the archives are slightly less broken and include permalinked dates. I’ll probably also fix up the colors and formatting later.

In short, reading the Daily Links on that page should be more pleasant than merely reading them on the sidebar of my main blog, and the best experience is still probably to read them in [your aggregator of choice](http://www.atomenabled.org/everyone/atomenabled/).
**Update**: I’ve moved the search over to MT-Search, Movable Type’s built-in search function, so it’s now about a million times more useful. I’ll probably be playing with this a bit more.
