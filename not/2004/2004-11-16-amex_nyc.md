I find this [IN:NYC](http://www.innyc.com/innyc.html) event-targetted card from American Express fascinating. I’ve always thought there’s more to mass customization of the credit card market than just putting sports teams’ logos on cards, but this direction is surprising to me. How small a niche is it profitable to target with a free card?
