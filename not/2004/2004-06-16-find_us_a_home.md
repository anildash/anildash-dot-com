One of the biggest prerequisites for [moving to San Francisco](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/05/19/moving_forward) is finding an apartment. Given [how well it worked last time](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/11/03/home_sweet_home), I’m asking you, my readers, to help out. I’m not quite familiar with San Francisco yet, so you’ll have to be kind if I don’t know what I’m talking about.

We’re looking for a place that allows a dog and a cat and has one or two bedrooms. I’m thinking proximate to SoMa (maybe Potrero Hill, the Mission, Noe Valley or Cole Valley?) and to mass transit, and if it’s the kind of neighborhood where a car might be needed on a weekly basis but not a *daily* basis, that’d be great.

Know of a place that’s available for the middle of July? Have a friend that’s moving out of a place? Let me know. If you recommend the place that’s chosen, I’ll be glad to slide a reward your way.
