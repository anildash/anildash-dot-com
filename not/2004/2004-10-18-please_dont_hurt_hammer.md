I find it oddly comforting that [MC Hammer’s wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer) is not only completely updated, but clearly written by a fan who’s only papered the thinnest veneer of objectivity on their fawning writeup of Hammer’s career. Beautiful.

Also fun is watching [Jay’s Hammer thread](http://www.hiphopmusic.com/archives/000364.html) go off the rails as the “a blog post is a direct channel to celebrities” contingent of the web shows up to praise the abortive “Full Blast”, this year’s requisite Hammer comeback attempt.
