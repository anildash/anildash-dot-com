One of this site’s annual traditions is that I post [the Panda Joke](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/03/08/panda_joke_iv) each year when I’m away for [SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com). So here goes:

A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders a sandwich. He eats the sandwich, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. As the panda stands up to go, the manager shouts, “Hey! Where are you going? You just shot my waiter, and you didn’t even pay for your sandwich!”

“Hey, man, I’m a PANDA!” the panda shouts back. “Look it up!”

The manager opens his dictionary and reads:

> Panda: A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterized by distinct black and white coloring. Eats shoots and leaves.

Now that that’s out of the way, if you’re in Austin, I hope I’ll see you tomorrow at [KICK!](__GHOST_URL__/kick) and on Monday at the [Blogging Next](http://www.sxsw.com/interactive/panels/index.php?action=detail&amp;con=ia&amp;id=63) panel.
