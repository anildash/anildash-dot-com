And for those of you watching along or looking for runners’ alerts, here’s the [official marathon site](http://www.ingnycmarathon.org/news/raceweek/index.html). If you’re adding your support onto the fan map linked in my last post, Flickr has a limit of 20 comments, so people outside NYC can add their notes to the [world map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anildash/1302508/).
