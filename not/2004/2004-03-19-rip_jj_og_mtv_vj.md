I don’t mean to be disrespectful, but as soon as I heard that [J.J. Jackson died](http://www.billboard.com/bb/daily/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000467935), I expected to see a response on [Adam Curry’s weblog](http://live.curry.com/). I mean, I know they’re from different classic eras of MTV VJ-hood, but I figured there was an alumni association or something. And it’s not like Nina Blackwood’s a blogger.

I’m also expecting a spate of "Hey! He’s black and his last name is Jackson!" epiphanies across the web. Some quick answers to your Jackson queries: Randy Jackson of American Idol? *Not* Randy Jackson of The Jacksons. Sigmund Tito Jackson? A *real* Jackson! The late J.J. Jackson? *Not* a real Jackson.

At any rate, sorry to see him go so young. I believe he’s the first VJ to have passed away, and perhaps the first prominent on-air talent at MTV to pass away. That’s especially hard to believe since Kurt Loder is actually older than Earth itself.
