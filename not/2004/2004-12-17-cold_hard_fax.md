Today, Ev Williams said [Faxing Sucks](http://www.evhead.com/2004/12/faxing-sucks.asp). But if you look back on the [web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20010412162756/www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?peeves.php), there’s clearly a record, on my sidebar, of me having said faxing sucks on April 11, 2000. That was four and a half years ago! Despite the fact that it took some time for the [message to get out](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/02/16/six_apart_buys_), I feel that my post on this subject was definitive. Ev has shown me disrespect by not acknowledging my earlier post on this topic, when it was clearly there in plain sight buried in the archives of an old version of my site’s design.
