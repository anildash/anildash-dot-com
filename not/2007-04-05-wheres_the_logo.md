Hmm, MSNBC gets a brand-new logo, presumably as part of the [new “spectrum” campaign](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17912203/) they’re doing, and yet [Brand New](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/) has no review of it! The shame!

It looks like [SS+K](http://ssk.com/index.html) (whose site is shamefully under construction in a very 1998 way), has been leading the effort to brand MSNBC as a “[Fuller Spectrum of News](http://www.spectrum.msnbc.com/)“. Though it’s alluding to the peacock logo MSNBC inherited from its NBC parentage, there’s clearly an allusion to having a broader focus of coverage than Fox News, too.

The lame part is the showcase at the “Spectrum” site, though. There’s a thing called “Spectrum TV”, which I thought might be an interesting visualization of their new initiative, but is basically just a trailer showing off the colors of the rainbow. There’s a screensaver, but I’m not really going to download an executable onto my system so that MSNBC can advertise itself. And there’s a game “NewsBreaker”, which I think is just a Breakout clone with headlines. That’s about two decades too late, and you can’t even play it yet anyway. They’ve got a long way to catch up to the addictiveness of [Desktop Tower Defense](http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/).

And then of course the whole thing is wrapped up in a Flash movie so I can’t link to any of these elements anyway. It’d all be forgiveable if the lettering in the new logo wasn’t so wonky-looking. Hello, design blogs, help me out here!
