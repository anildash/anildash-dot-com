I am somewhat confused, as I try very hard not to keep up with the news these days, but if I understand correctly, our allegedly conservative chief executive is advocating the creation of a new, large bureaucratic department as a solution to a problem. And part of the problem, right now, is that there are too many places that security information gets dispersed to. So the answer is to create *another*? And this fourth department of national security will somehow be less prone to inter-department competitiveness and hierarchially-structured organizational ineptitude?

I am going to go put my head back into the hole in the sand.
