Lionel Richie’s “Hello” is, of course, the most moving and emotional music video of all time.* In the more than two decades since its release, it’s also become a touchstone for inept sculptors worldwide. Especially in [Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Richie#Popularity_in_the_Middle_East). Thus, it’s imperative that I direct you to [The Hello Experiment](http://www.leanmeanfightingmachine.co.uk/hello/), a film for those who understand how truly important this work of art is. (Thanks to [Ben](http://btrott.vox.com/library/post/random-links.html) for the link.)
* Note: You shut up with your whining.
