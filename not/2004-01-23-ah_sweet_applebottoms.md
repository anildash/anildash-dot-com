It’s really unseemly how much we’re enjoying watching Nelly’s “Search for Miss Applebottom” on VH1. It’s basically an entire show about Nelly looking at women’s asses, ostensibly searching for models for his Applebottom line of jeans. Highlight thus far? The woman who, referring to her own ass, said, “I can make it clap.”

Indeed.
