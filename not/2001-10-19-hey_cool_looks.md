Hey, cool! Looks like my [Pardon Me For Being Forward](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_08_01_archive.php#5238868) got me picked as [alt.gossip.celebrities](http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;frame=right&amp;th=9a6514c4a43cb663&amp;seekm=20011019084954.12846.00000133%40mb-fd.aol.com#link1)â€˜ [site of the day](http://members.aol.com/pusssykatt/agcwebsites.html). I like when individuals in a community pick links that they find interesting, and use that as the basis for an award, and this seems to be one of those situations. So, thanks, a.g.c.
