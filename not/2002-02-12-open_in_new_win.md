Why do people, even super standards-compliant people, make links that open up in new windows? If I want my browser to do something non-standard, I’ll damn well *tell* it to. If people are hell-bent on being compatible, why would you assume the reader is even on a platform that can easily allow them to navigate that new window?

I don’t want a checkbox to choose the behavior, I just want it to work right. Most users have no concept of how to navigate multiple browser windows. Sucks.
