There are people doing the work of science, manufacturing knowledge for the rest of us. I like to read about what they do, and maybe you will too. Go lookit [Gareth Hughes](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~gvh/), whose work on assigning relevancy and context to hyperlinks is, I think, exactly in line with the future directions of the web and the Internet in general.

Or, see [Natalie Jeremijenko](http://cat.nyu.edu/natalie/)‘s work. She’s done a broad range of stuff, but a great example of some interactive art that she’s made is [this presentation](http://www.yale.edu/dmca/lectures99/jeremijenko.html), where she shows that art involving technology can be fun, interesting, and accessible while still being meaningful.
