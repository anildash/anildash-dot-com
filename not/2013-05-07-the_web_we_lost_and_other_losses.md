I got the chance to revisit some of the themes of [the Web We Lost](the Web We Lost) in the broader context of how we confront our mortality and impermanence in the digital realm on WNYC a few weeks ago. I’m pleased with how the conversation came out, and if you’ve got 15 minutes, you can listen to it here.
