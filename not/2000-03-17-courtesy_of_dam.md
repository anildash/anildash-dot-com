Courtesy of [damaged](http://www.pixeldiva.co.uk/damaged/) comes [The New Yankee Worshop Drinking Game](http://www.crosslink.net/~spam/nywdrink.html). Especially ironic that I like this, since I don’t drink. But I do **love home improvement shows**. (Double irony: I *hate* the actual "Home Improvement" show….)

The coolest thing was having a client a few years ago that was a construction company… one of their subcontractors was… you guessed it… *the* Norm of the New Yankee Workshop.

Sigh. If only I’d gotten to meet him.
