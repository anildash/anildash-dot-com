Also, yesterday, John Dvorak published an article called "Deconstructing the Blog", denigrating weblogs. [I rebutted](http://discuss.pcmag.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=pcmag&amp;msg=6116.1) in the comments section of the website and the conversation, curiously, has ended. But I like what I wrote, maybe you will too.
