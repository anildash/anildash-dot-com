I’m doing a number of presentations and public appearances over the next several weeks, here’s a quick chronological overview if you’d like to meet up.

- The [AAAS Annual Meeting](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/) in San Diego, this week from Feb 18-20. The American Association for the Advancement of Science is the parent organization for my new project [Expert Labs](http://expertlabs.org/), so I’m extraordinarily excited to get to attend and participate in this event for the first time. Even if you’re not a scientist, you can check out [Family Science Days](http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2010/program/fsd/) for some very cool events that are open to the public.
- [Sweets and Treats](http://sweetsandtweets4.eventbrite.com/) on March 10 in Washington, DC. Debbie Weil’s great event for bringing together DC’s tech and government communities looks really promising, and that was even *before* I knew there was gonna be free cupcakes.
- [South by Southwest](http://sxsw.com/) in Austin, TX on March 12-16. I’m really looking forward to this — [Break Bread for Brad](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2010/02/break-bread-for-brad.html) in memory of [Brad Graham](http://dashes.com/anil/2010/01/remembering-brad-l-graham.html) on the night of the 12th, the [KICK](http://dashes.com/kick/) kickball game is coming back on the morning of Saturday the 13th (more about that soon!), I’ll be returning to [Battledecks](http://www.rocketboom.com/rb_08_mar_13/) (this time as a judge), and of course all the usual Austin festivities.
- Fast Company’s [Innovation Uncensored](http://innovationuncensored.com/) conference, April 21. I’d be excited just to *attend* this one — it’s even more thrilling to get to present. Take a look at the lineup of speakers and I bet you’ll agree.
- [Gov 2.0 Expo](http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010), May 25-27. I can already tell there’s been a huge shift in the conversation about how government and technology relate, and if last fall’s Gov 2.0 Summit was a watershed moment, this might be even more of a milestone.

And, if you can’t make it to any of those events, I’ll be doing a few things online, such as [this career event](http://www.careerjoy.com/events/last-years-model-redeeming-and-re-purposing-your-skills-with-legendary-blogger-and-founding-director-of-expertlabs-anil-d) about looking at your job skills in the context of [Last Year’s Model](http://lastyearsmodel.org/). I’ll likely be adding in a few additional events, including Chicago in early March, which I’m hoping will let me meet even more of you. Oh, and of course I’ll be blogging here as well, if you really don’t feel like going anywhere.
