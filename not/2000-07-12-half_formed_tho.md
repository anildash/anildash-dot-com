**Half formed thought**: Hack PHP on my other server so that pages are output to a specified FTP location. Voila! **Blogger Clone**. Minus the Pyra stuff, of course. Because the secret really is the pre-processing.

Hmmm…. outsourced hypertext preprocessing. Pyra’s an ASP, but not for project management, for HTML pre-processing. If I liked WAP, I’d want Blogger to spit that out. And why doesn’t it output in XML (particularly RSS) yet? (I know there’s a [hack](http://www.blogger.com/howto/xml_asp_1.pyra) for it…)
