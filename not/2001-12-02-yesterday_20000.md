Yesterday 20,000 Canadians [came to our city to wish us well](http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011201/ts/life_canada_newyork_dc_1.html). I know I’ve made many jokes at the expense of Canadians here, but I owe it to the half-dozen people I talked to yesterday to say that the effort and the care it took to make the trip here were more appreciated than you might know.

And, in case any of you people I talked to manage to find your way to my website, the red and white hats weren’t *really* so bad. At least it made it easy for us to identify the Canadian infiltrators among us. And I’ll never forget the site of 6th Avenue lined with thousands and thousands of maple-leaf-emblazoned tourists.
