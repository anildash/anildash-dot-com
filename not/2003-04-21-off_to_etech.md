I’m off to SF for [O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etcon/) on Tuesday. I’m going against the grain this year by taking my laptop along, “blogging” in “realtime”, and taking digital photos of people. If there’s a box, I am out of it. If you’re attending as well, stop by and say hello…I’ll be the guy with the laptop and digital camera.
