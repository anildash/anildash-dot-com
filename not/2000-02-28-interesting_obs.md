Interesting observation, now that I work in a mostly-Mac office… (I have the only PC) **All of the Mac users have PC’s at home** in addition to their Macs, which they use **almost exclusively for browsing the web**. The reasons for this became especially clear when I rediscovered just how **unbelievably slow web browsing is on the Mac**.

Mac users, [let me know](mailto:anil@dashes.com): do you use a PC to browse? Are you aware how much slower Mac browsers are on comparable hardware?

And it’s not a religious issue, I like Macs plenty. It’s just amazing that they’ve lagged so far behind in such a critical area.
