So far the whole Y2K End-of-the-World Armageddon Spectacular has been **somewhat underwhelming**, but I’ve already gotten to hear rampant urban legends (of unknown veracity) about the NYPD stockpiling bodybags and Madison Square Garden’s basement being turned into a standby morgue *just in case*… heh heh heh.

Perhaps the best angle I’ve heard was from the **toll collector** I stopped for at the Queens Midtown Tunnel… as I got my change he said, "Good night! Enjoy the explosion!"

What a sense of humor, that guy…
