Milking the “controversy” over Cinnamon Girl for all it’s worth, the local Twin Cities press talks to [the guys who made the video](http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/9962031.htm). If nothing else, they should be commended for making the first Prince video in 10 years that doesn’t look like he did it at home in iMovie.

Part of the reason I know it’s a good video is because [Michelle Malkin hates it](http://michellemalkin.com/archives/000635.htm). Interestingly, she critiques Prince (well, she doesn’t know he changed his name back) instead of the guys who actually *made* the video. 2 bad 4 u, Michelle!
