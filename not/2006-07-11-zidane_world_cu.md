Zinedine Zidane’s savage headbutt of Marco Materazzi in the World Cup final has touched on [many things](http://www.kottke.org/06/07/the-zidane-headbutt): Race, family, country, terrorism, sportsmanship. But more than anything else, it’s united the entire Internet around the most important thing. Wacky animations!

In light of this historic moment, and thanks to the efforts of citizens of [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/52906), [Something Awful](http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?s=607e7487806eac3d40a13da5f80e7379&amp;threadid=1950611), [b3ta](http://b3ta.com/board/), and other online communities, I sifted through *dozens* of the best/worst Zidane-related animations online. All this to bring you the following movie I made last night, dedicated to the head-first fight against alleged racism, the grand tradition of ridiculous memes on the net, and the premise that “Yakety Sax” is always funny.

**Update:** This little movie’s turned out to be pretty popular! It’s been featured in the [Time Shares Exhibition](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/time-shares-exh.html) at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City, as well as the [Avant Gaming Exhibition](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/01/pretentious-artist.html) at the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University.
