From the list of “things I thought I’d never see”, Karl Pearson-Cater (he and I were colleagues about a decade ago) posted a [great job listing](http://www.minnpost.com/insideminnpost/2010/10/14/22351/minnpost_looking_for_assistant_web_editor) at MinnPost, which lists the following requirement:

- You know the difference between an “em-dash” and an “en-dash” and you know a little about “Anil Dash”

In case you’re interested in the job, here’s the Wikipedia page on [dashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash) and here’s my [about page](http://dashes.com/anil/about.html). Good luck, aspiring web editors!
