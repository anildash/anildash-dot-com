From my [Facebook Usernames post](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/06/the-future-of-facebook-usernames.html) on June 10:

> **July 31, 2009:** MySpace announces MyAddress, a feature for providing more control over the URL where your MySpace profile appears. Instead of constraining users to a few choices as Facebook does, MySpace gives users very broad control over what kind of address they can have. As a result, users pick web addresses that exactly match their obscure handles on the service, instead of using their real names.

From [TechCrunch today](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/30/the-new-myspace-mail-quietly-emerges-as-a-big-time-email-competitor/), talking about MySpace’s announcement for July 31 (emphasis mine):

> Here’s what else is nice: Because MySpace has had so-called vanity URLs since its inception (unlike Facebook, which just rolled out the feature), you can use those as your email address with the new MySpace Mail. So for a page that resides at myspace.com/techcrunch, the email would be [techcrunch@myspace.com](mailto:techcrunch@myspace.com), for example. **And, if you don’t like the vanity URL you currently have, MySpace is giving you the opportunity to change it to something else (assuming it’s available). This would also change your vanity URL for your profile.**

I love the tech industry. I really do.
