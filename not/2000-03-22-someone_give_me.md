Someone give me some **insight on PHP**. I’m realizing I’m probably going to have to jump with both feet into PHP for a project at work, but I’m trying to avoid learning anything useful. Anyone know of any really good resources? A way to avoid learning? A consultant who’s really, really cheap and available in the vicinity of Manhattan?

[Let me know](mailto:anil@dashes.com). Thanks so much!
