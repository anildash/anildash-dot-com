The thing that alternately fascinates and infuriates me is the sheer arrogance, gall and insensitivity of the assumption that we all believe in a god, and that it’s the same one as yours. "Well, god bless you!" as if it’s just the same as saying "the sun exists!" And how offended would you be if I made the same presumption? "I tell ya, beautiful weather like today is just proof of the beauty of science and meteorology untroubled by supernatural powers, irrational mythology or omnipotent beings!"

And then suddenly *I’m* the bad guy.
