I’ve been meaning to post this for a long time. To those of you who wanted to know **how to pronounce my name**, (no, it doesn’t sound like “Anal”) you can hear a close approximation of how I say it by looking up the word [anneal](http://www.bartleby.com/61/58/A0315800.html). Only I say it with a little less excitement than the guy on that site.

The odd thing is that my pronounciation isn’t even that common for guys named Anil here in the U.S. But that’s how my parents taught me to say it. My parents have a tendency to make things up, sometimes, though, so my name may actually be an elaborate practical joke that they’ve been playing on me for a quarter-century now.

Which would kind of fit in with my life in general.
