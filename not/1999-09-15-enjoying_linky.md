As young Anakin Skywalker might say, "**Yippee!**" I was not once, not twice, but *thrice* linked yesterday, all by esteemed logs.

To follow my progression as a meme, one can see me pop up at [PeterMe](http://www.peterme.com), and then progress to [Eatonweb](http://www.eatonweb.com), whence came a mention (and rather neat rebuttal by Dan Hartung to my thoughts on Staples, et al.) over at [Lake Effect](http://www.wwa.com/~dhartung/weblog/)[.](.)

Of course, much to my chagrin, the influx of new visitors were brought in just in time to notice that most of my [Dumb Pictures](#dumpic) were broken links. **Egg on my face, indeed**.

And as to Peter’s comment that my site lacks info on me, well far be it from me to not indulge my self-centered nature… expect tons of **Anil-related content** to unveil itself here shortly…
