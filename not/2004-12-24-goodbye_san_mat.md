Six Apart moved into our new offices today, and though he doesn’t blog often, he gets it right when he does: [Ben covers my thoughts exactly](http://btrott.typepad.com/typepad/2004/12/start_to_move.html). I’ll be spending the next week with family and friends, but today I want to say happy holidays to all my friends at Six Apart, and I’m so excited to be moving into a new office with such a talented crew.
