Yahoo just [bought Bloomba’s creators](http://www.statalabs.com/), Stata Labs. And promptly shut down downloads. While it seems like a nice feature to complement Oddpost in the presumable future Yahoo Mail, it’s a bummer that we can’t download the app in the meantime. I also didn’t realize that I literally work down the street from the Bloomba folks.
