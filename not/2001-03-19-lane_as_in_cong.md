[Lane](http://www.monstro.com/past/2001_03_01_index.html#2834251) (as in "Congratulations, Lane!") goes more into depth on the comments about starting a business that he made at the panel Peter was talking about. Basically, a longer rumination on the [reality-distortion field](http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/r/reality-distortion_field.html) that you need to generate around your efforts.

Everybody drink the kool-aid, man, I made it myself.
