Hmmm, New Year and I’ve got a new computer on the way. Now all I have to do is find a new job, new apartment, and a new woman. Sigh. The worst part is I didn’t want to have to be looking for any of those things right now, but it’s not up to me…

But, **opportunity**! That is the key. I wonder what happens next?
