A while back, Gillette released the [M3Power Razor](http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00024C110/2020-20), a [motorized razor](http://www.gillettem3power.com/home_f.asp) based on their [fan-favorite](http://www.sixfoot6.com/index.php?x=http://www.sixfoot6.com/fruit/000176.html) Mach 3. Now, as many of you may recall, [I care about razors](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/04/05/sharp_as_a_razo). I’d seen [a TV show](http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/betterbydesign/razor/challenge.html) a while back explaining how to optimize the shaving razor, and it explained one key element to optimal shaving that’s still missing: motion. Though Gilette had blown through [a billion bucks](http://www.theaustralianvoice.com/bestamancanget.html) on the product line thus far, it seemed a glaring oversight.

But no longer. They’ve got millions of razors deployed, all motorized , and the AAA battery is included. (Why just give charge for the blades when you can charge for the blades *and* batteries?) You know where I’m going with this, though. There’s a huge market for plausible deniability vibrators here. Just add an alternate tip that plugs into the razor end, or a cover for the blunt end, and voila. Shy people, or travellers, or those who live in states where such masturbatory paraphernalia are prohibited, would be liberated from their sexual oppression.

I figure you could sell the “massager” tips for the Mach 3 for about five bucks. If you make a million dollars, buy me something nice.
