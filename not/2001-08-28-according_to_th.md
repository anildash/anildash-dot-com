Which makes me curious as to what m�lange of substances, exactly, would create the horrifying sensations suffered by any who eat the latest addition to my office’s vending machines, [Wise](http://www.wisesnacks.com/ns/)[Smokin’ Grill Burger N Fixin’s Flavor Potato Chips](http://www.taquitos.net/chipworld/Wise-SG.shtml).
