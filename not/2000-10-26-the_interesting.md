The interesting thing about the apparent plagiarism between [9 Net Avenue](http://www.9netavenue.co.uk/services/real/prices.shtml) and
[EmotionWeb](http://www.emotionweb.com/encoding.htm) is that the table of pricing was copied over *exactly* except for the currency signs, which were changed. They didnâ€™t even bother to convert the amounts.
