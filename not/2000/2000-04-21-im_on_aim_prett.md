I’m on [AIM](http://www.aol.com/aim/) pretty much all the time (go ahead, check– my name is **AnilDash**) but it’s annoying how each new version of AIM includes more ads, more useless stock tickers (that default to *on*…? Duh.) and crap like that. So I’m going to try out Novell’s AIM-compatible [instantme](http://www.novell.com/products/instantme/) and see how I like it.

At the very least, I know it doesn’t have any ads.
