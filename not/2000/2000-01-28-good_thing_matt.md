Good thing Matthew pointed it out in his blog, or I might have missed that he’s got a nice [glbt weblog portal](http://www.hit-or-miss.org/glbt/) on his site now. It’s like Eatonweb’s list, only with more *style*.

Which reminds me, I *still* don’t get the UPS guy thing. Maybe it’s because I can’t wear brown clothes myself.
