Is it *too* geeky, even for a weblog, for me to say that I think the [weblog map](http://www2.ucsc.edu/~rsdio/weblog/wlm.html) is **beautiful**? And, speaking of geeky, [Q](http://q.queso.com) and [Lake Effect](http://www.wwa.com/~dhartung/weblog/index.html) readers will be glad to know that I, too, am schooling myself in the intricacies of Windows 2000. Although I had the same problem as Dan, I thought it wouldn’t be an appropriate subject for my blog. Thanks to Dan for helping me come out of the Win2K closet.

And, speaking of **personal firewalls**, I strongly recommend Windows 9x users go with [Zone Alarm](http://www.zonealarm.com). I have a cable modem, and it’s scary how many attempts are made to access my poor little notebook. I don’t recommend it for Win2000 users yet, just because it’s seemed a little flaky on my setup.

The best independent resource on ZoneAlarm is over at [Gibson Research](http://grc.com/zonealarm.htm), which is Steve Gibson’s company. I know him as the guy who invented the [Koala Light Pen](http://grc.com/lpsiic.jpg) for my Commodore 64.
