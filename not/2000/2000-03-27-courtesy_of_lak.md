Courtesy of [Lake Effect](http://www.wwa.com/~dhartung/weblog/index.html) (from whom I steal more links….) comes a nice ChiTrib article on [how software development became such a big industry in India](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/article/0,2669,SAV-0003250070,FF.html).

Which reminds me… is anyone interested in a blog portal for bloggers of Indian descent? Been kicking the idea around for a while. "Putting the ‘Dot’ in Dot-Com".
