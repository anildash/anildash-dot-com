I’m half-asleep, so forgive me if this is incoherent, but the way to find out if people prefer *open source* software or *free* (as in beer) software, is to compare the number of **downloads of binaries** to the number of **downloads of source**. If it’s even a 10-to-1 ratio I’d be surprised.

Which means that people like the open source stuff because it’s free and pretty good. If Windows 2000 were free, my company’s server would run on that, because humans can do basic administration tasks.
