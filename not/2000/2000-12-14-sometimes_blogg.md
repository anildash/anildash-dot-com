Sometimes blogging is depressing. Like today, when I noticed that a [Metafilter thread](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/4786) popped up on something I [blogged two weeks ago](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2000_12_01_archive.php#1526045).

Not that I’m so self-obsessed that I think everyone reads my page, but I would think there would be some overlap in readership. Especially since I’ve been blogging **longer than 99.9% of the bloggers out there**. (No, really. I did the math.)

Of course, it’s just a silly thread, but I was disheartened to see evidence of my sneaking suspicion that all of these pages just evaporate into the ether (net) as soon as I finish typing.
