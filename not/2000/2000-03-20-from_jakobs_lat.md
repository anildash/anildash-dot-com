From Jakob’s latest [Alertbox](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html):

> Please don’t write me for reprints of this paper: that’s what libraries are for.

**Ugh**. I guess anyone with the confidence to cite *themselves* as one of the references for their writing wouldn’t still consider it an honor to be asked… but if someone were to ask for a copy of a paper I’d written, I’d be *flattered*.

And that’s not a very *usable* suggestion anyway, is it? Couldn’t there be hyperlink to a .PDF of the file right there?
