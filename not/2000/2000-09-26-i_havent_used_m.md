I haven’t used Microsoft Access for years, I guess I’m dating myself, but I actually remember the bugs in version 1 and how badly the 1.1 update was needed. Regardless, I had a chance to import an Excel sheet into Access for the first time in ages, and I was truly impressed that it used a wizard to **automatically normalize the data**.

Hell, that’s a concept I couldn’t teach some co-workers I’ve had, and this program does it on its own…
