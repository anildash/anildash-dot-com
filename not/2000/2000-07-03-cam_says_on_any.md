[Cam says](http://www.camworld.com/):

> On any given day there are between three and eight million people in the NYC metro area. Yesterday, while in a bookstore in the Upper West Side, I ran into my boss. What are the odds? Maybe the odds are better because about half the city has retreated to the country and vicinity for the holiday weekend.

And while his observation on everyone having left the city is accurate, he reveals his recent arrival to the City by not knowing that, indeed, New York City is the **Biggest Little Town on Earth**. I *regularly* run into people in all different parts of town, though I know precious few people who live here. In fact, my best friend ran into me in midtown and then my partner in crime Helen on the Upper East Side in the space of three days.

And did you know I ran into D’Angelo? It’s true.
