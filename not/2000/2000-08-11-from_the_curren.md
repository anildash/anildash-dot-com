From the current issue of [News of the Weird](http://www.newsoftheweird.com):

And, from [Snopes.com’s article on Joey Skaggs](http://www.snopes.com/critters/edibles/dogsoup.htm):

> No discussion of Skagg’s tricksterism would be complete without a mention of the Solomon Project, an amazing but thoroughly fake computer program that could review a court case, apply the law, and spit out a ruling. The promise of an impartial electronic contraption that would remove human foibles from the judicial system proved irresistible to a world bone-tired of the O.J. case. CNN sent a camera crew to interview Mr. Bonuso (Skaggs) at his New York laboratory — a SoHo loft he’d packed with actors posing as refugees from the Microsoft Corporation. At its peak, the hoax involved some 25 grim-faced actors pumping data into computer terminals as CNN cameras recorded the performance. CNN aired the segment on 29 December 1995.

**Fiction becomes truth!** (And thanks to [Dan](http://www.wwa.com/~dhartung/weblog/) for the Snopes article a while back. Great redesign, by the way, sorry I’ve been too busy to compliment it…)
