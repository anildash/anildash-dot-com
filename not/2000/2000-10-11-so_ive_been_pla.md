So I’ve been playing around this week with **extracting the bitmaps out of all the programs** on my computer and seeing what little graphical surprises lie in store. Mostly expected stuff, although I can’t *believe* just how many extra splash screens Adobe lards into their programs. I think half of ImageReady’s disk footprint is splash screens for beta versions. I’ll post them later.
