Is it odd that I’ve tried on several computers now, but I still get the same results: *Every link* on [Xerox’s homepage](http://www.xerox.com) yields a server error. Aren’t they a little big to be making mistakes like that?

At any rate, you can go to [http://www2.xerox.com/](http://www2.xerox.com/) and you can find working links; Apparently they’re testing a new design.
