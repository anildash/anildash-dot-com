Great comment over at [rebecca’s pocket](http://www.rebeccablood.net/):

> A quarter of the new drugs now being developed by pharmaceuticals are antidepressants. I am well acquainted with the debilitating effects of depression and fully support the development of any means to relieve the terrible suffering of those who are afflicted with this disease. But when so many of us are so afflicted I have to ask myself if there is something about the way we live that is exacerbating this problem? And are doctors prescribing drugs to treat the symptom of larger cultural/societal problems? Are we, to some extent, trying to medicate ourselves into being happy, productive members of society? People with money (upper-middle class and up) are obviously buying these drugs or the pharmaceutical companies wouldn’t expend so many resources in producing them.
