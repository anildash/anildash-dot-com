Nice recounting of the sources for many common samples, called [These Are the Breaks](http://formen.ign.com/news/29351.html). I have a bad habit in our office of Napstering down whatever track provided **the samples in the songs everyone else is playing**. Gets on their nerves, but I get to prove my "Geekier Than Thou" status.

Actually, speaking of samples, I just burned a CD tonight for my friend of all the Lomax recordings that provided the samples for Moby’s *Play* album. And I didn’t feel too guilty puling them off Napster since they’re all public domain anyway. You do know about [the Lomax recordings](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/lohtml/lohome.html), don’t you?
