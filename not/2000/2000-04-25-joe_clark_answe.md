[Joe Clark](http://www.electricseed.com/joeclark/home.html) answered my query a while ago about the cabal of designers who inflict their personal color palette choices on the rest of us: the [Color Marketing Group](http://www.colormarketing.org/cmg/siteindex.htm).

Being an overbearing curmudgeon myself, I was thinking of joining, but it turns out I’m ineligible as **I don’t have a four-year degree**. I’m wondering how many great artists they’ve excluded due to that requirement…?

grumble, grumble…
