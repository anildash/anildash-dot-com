So I think I’m going to join the throngs running down to their local [Circuit City](http://www.circuitcity.com) and snapping up the [i-Opener](http://www.netpliance.com), since it’s a little PC you can buy for $100. Add some hardware and geek elbow-grease, and you’ve got a real, working PC with a flat screen.

Oh, I just found out that [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,34977,00.html) did an article on it, but the best resource so far is [I-Opener Today](http://www.higuchi-clark.com/iopener/).
