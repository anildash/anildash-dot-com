**Blogging Renaissance!**

Several of the blogs that got me in the game are back, or redesigned. [Peter](http://www.peterme.com)‘s got a subtle redesign, and he finally made his site match his business cards, which had always bothered me in the past when it didn’t. [Lane](http://www.monstro.com)‘s got an un-design in place now, and at long last, it’s the return of the [nubbin](http://www.nubbin.com)!

And while I’m at it, big props to [Ev](http://www.evhead.com) for **putting his money where his mouse is**, he clicked on my little paypal logo and sent me a buck. I mention this not because I’m pimping for dollars, but because I’ve always thought that the way to make micropayments happen is to, well, micropay. I had been using the link as a payment option for my freelance clients (did I mention [I’m available for freelance jobs again](mailto:anil@dashes.com?subject=opportunity)?) but it was also out there in case anyone wanted to be so generous.

So get off your asses, the rest of you bloggers, and **add the links to those PayPal accounts** that I know you have. [Dan](http://www.lakefx.nu), [Jason](http://q.queso.com), [Brig](http://www.eatonweb.com): There’s a little something in it for you folks if you add the links.
