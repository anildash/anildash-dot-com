We’re going to see [Fantasia 2000](http://disney.go.com/DisneyPictures/fantasia2000/index.html) tonight. Despite some misgivings I have about Mouse, Inc. I think that the original Fantasia was **one of the closest things to pure art that mass culture has ever allowed to flourish**, and it comforts me to no end that there are millions of kids growing up who have amongst the pile of VHS tapes in their living rooms a plastic-cased Disney Classics version of the original film.

Needless to say, since I like Imax and the original, I’m hoping to like the new film. Until I’ve seen it, digested it, and reviewed it, go read what [Dan Bricklin](http://danbricklin.com/log/boldreactions.htm) has to say about **using bold to emphasize items in a weblog**.

Actually, I don’t technically make my entries bold, I make them **strong**. I just like the implications of that.
