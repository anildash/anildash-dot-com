Microsoft finally updated [Tweak UI](http://fileforum.efront.com/detail.php3?fid=969556660) for Windows Me and 2000. Best feature: It lets your **customize the places bar** in the file dialogs. I’m *so* glad I don’t have to hack around in the registry to figure out how to do it manually.

**Addendum**: I took a look at it, and it’s not really a *custom* places bar; You can’t put your own folder entries into the bar. I’ll poke around the registry later to figure it out, then post it here.
