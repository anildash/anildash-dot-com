One interesting note from the **Camvention** last week was that I definitely felt like a **second-class citizen** when I whipped out my Windows CE PDA after dinner. Everyone else was beaming their Palmistry to one another, and I was in my own little digital enclave, feeling like I could use a little [e-speranto](http://www.esperanto.net/info/index_en.html).

The interesting thing to me is that most people who like the Palm are **underdog apologists**, definitely of the Mac-using personality type, yet they hold no truck for Windows CE despite its decided disadvantage in the marketplace. Of course, it’s obvious why, but I thought it was interesting.

For the record, I have a CE device because it was a gift from my best friend, and one of the finest gifts I’ve ever recieved. I’m officially platform-agnostic.
