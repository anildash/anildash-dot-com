**Half-developed idea**: Hack the [Apache](http://www.apache.org) source code and one of the open-source [AIM](http://www.aol.com/aim) clones and make a way of having a shared folder attached to everyone’s IM name. Once IM’s are standardized and have evolved into a decentralized, serverless system, you’ve got the next-generation web.
