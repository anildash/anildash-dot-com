Ah, yes, I can now pat myself on the back for my prescience. My **Fadmaker** mentions the *Beat It* jacket, and now from [News of the Weird](http://www.newsoftheweird.com) comes this item:

> Among the new dog designer fashions unveiled at the 12th Pat Pet Friend
> 
> Festival in November in Bangkok: **a red-and-black, Michael Jackson-style
> 
> military coat**; a yellow-and-black bike racing jacket with bike-style
> 
> helmet; a silver space suit-like cape; and a blue silk gown. According
> 
> to designer Vasinee Apornpanit, the biggest market by far for dressing
> 
> up dogs is Japan, where pet owners are now asking for cell phones and
> 
> other high-tech gadgets to be sewn onto the dogs’ outfits.

I’m still looking to buy either one of these or the *Thriller* jacket, by the way. You’d think that’s what [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com) was invented for…
