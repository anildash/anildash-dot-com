Did everyone remember to go get their [OneName](http://www.onename.com)? It’s a similar idea to Microsoft’s [Passport](http://www.passport.com), but it’s based on an open, XML content description format. You can go back and read my old review of Passport [here](http://www.dashes.com/anil/093099.html). (Scroll down to September 22.)

Wasn’t all this stuff supposed to be handled by vCards? What the hell happened to those?
