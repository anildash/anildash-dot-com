From [harrumph!](http://www.harrumph.com/):

> Is it just me or did anyone else find it incredibly tacky that the cameras panned to Jack Nicholson when Anjelica Huston was up at the podium last night? Did they pan to Brad Pitt when Gwyneth was presenting? It was a very “I’ve seen you naked” moment.

True, but more annoying to me is the "Foreign Film" category, where they had Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz presenting, and went to Gloria Estefan for the reaction shot. Too bad I don’t have a webcam, or you could have gotten my reaction every time they showed [M. Night Shyamalan](http://us.imdb.com/Bio?Shyamalan,+M.+Night)…
