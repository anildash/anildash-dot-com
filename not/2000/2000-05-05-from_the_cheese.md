From the [Cheese Archive](http://www.spinthebottle.com/cheese_archive.asp#):

> Danny Aiello felt compelled to record a follow-up to Madonna’s “Papa Don’t Preach” which told the story from “Papa’s” perspective. The result is horrific and baffling. Look at it. LOOK AT IT!

It’s a truly spectacular follow-up to Madonna’s *Papa Don’t Preach*… you have to see it to believe it.
