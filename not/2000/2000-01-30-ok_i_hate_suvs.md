Ok, I hate SUV’s, but I *am* a geek, so I have to say I actually like station wagons. And the one I’ve liked ever since I first saw the design was the [PT Cruiser](http://www.chryslercars.com/pt_cruiser/). It’s weird, it looks like it was designed by true geeks, and best of all, it’s **cheap**.

Anyone wanna get me one of these? I’ll be your best friend.
