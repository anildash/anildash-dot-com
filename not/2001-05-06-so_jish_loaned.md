So, [Jish](http://www.jish.nu/) loaned me one of his man-purses back in March when were were in Texas, and since then I’ve been somewhat enamored of the concept, just because of the convenience. So, yesterday, I picked [one of ’em](http://www.bananarepublic.com/product.asp?loc=man&amp;wdid=1450&amp;wpid=101721&amp;continueShopURL=introsubdept.asp) up for myself, a nice black one.

And now everybody is making fun of me. But I don’t care, because I can take my little digital camera along with me everywhere, along with a book and some paper and stuff.

It’s nice. So screw you guys. Or, join the gang and [make fun of my purse](javascript:viewComments(3515983)). ( echo commentCount(3515983); ?>)
