I’m wondering why I didn’t know about this before, but it’s **really damned cool**: [The Lycos 50](http://50.lycos.com/) is a regular column that is written based on the top 50 items that users search for at Lycos.

I especially like the "One To Watch" and "Mystery Terms" sections; Nice to know that some searches are so obscure **even the experts don’t know** why people are typing them into their browsers…
