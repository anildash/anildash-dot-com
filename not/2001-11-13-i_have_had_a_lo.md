I have had a lot of thoughts in the past year about Microsoft’s [Tablet PC](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/) initiative, and I’ll cover those later. But, there is one opportunity from their push that everyone can benefit from right now: [discounts on Wacom tablets](http://www.wacom.com/developer/). It even works on Macs, so Apple partisans can let Microsoft subsidize their hardware purchases.
