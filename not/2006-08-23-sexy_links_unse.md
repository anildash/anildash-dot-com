- “[Two of the most financially successful Web 2.0 personalities … are rooting for the financial failure of their competitors.](http://blogs.zdnet.com/micro-markets/?p=343)” Hmm. I tend to root for the success of our company’s competitiors, because I want the entire industry to be healthy, I think the competition is good for all of us, and because I actually give a damn about the web. I’m not sure if I believe the sentiment that’s quoted above, but I do know there are lots of people who take digs at their competitors or wish them ill. In the long term, this is a self-correcting problem. Be careful what you wish for, etc.
- On a not-entirely-unrelated note, [congratulations, Jason](http://goldtoe.net/2006/08/for-love-of-b.html). A break is well-deserved, and a lot of what [Mena said about Ev](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2004/10/ev_moves_on.html) applies here as well.
- What’s it look like after people have rooted for your failure but you make it work anyway? It looks like a [WSJ profile of marca](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115586867122639111-cW9juzaIBrDbHoHmZEplq3_dltM_20070818.html?mod=blogs). I remember being in high school and my [Morrissey-listening](http://youtube.com/watch?v=CtrIgf902ZI) friends would tell me they would hate it if I became successful.

](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000H305U0/2020-20) What was that about successful friends? Dear Flickr team: Did you know the official [Justin Timberlake SexyBack Tour Photo Contest](http://www.flickr.com/groups/sexyback/) happens to run as a Flickr photo group? I’m also pretty entertained by the cover of the new album, [FutureSex / LoveSounds](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000H305U0/2020-20), which is pictured here. (See also: my earlier review of [SexyBack](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/17/justin_timberla), the lead single.)
- The other kids aren’t listening to Justin Timberlake, they’re listening to Kelly Clarkson! So says the wildly erratic [Google Music Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/music), which relies on the apparently completely unreliable “Now Playing” status of Google Talk to determine song popularity.
- Want to talk to Google Talk users without using Google’s system at all? For free? Using open source software? [Hmm, that sounds interesting…](http://www.livejournal.com/ljtalk/) Act now and we’ll throw in a free Jabber server.
- If you’re not sick of me yet, pick up this month’s *Wired*. The story’s not online yet, but I talk a bit about spam blogs (as [mentioned by Steve Rubel](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2006/08/splogs_threaten.html)) but come off sounding a little half-witted at points. That’s okay.
- And finally, some outstanding conversations have started based on my [talk at MeshForum](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1069.html) a few months ago. [Slouching Toward the Era of Quality of Life](http://www.ramanarao.com/blog/archives/2006/08/meshforum_anil.html), [What blogspace needs now](http://neologies.blogspot.com/2006/08/what-blogspace-needs-now.html) and [Audience and purpose in blogging](http://katisha-whenyouthinkaboutit.blogspot.com/2006/08/audience-and-purpose-in-blogging.html) all delighted me with the great ideas that seemed to come from these bloggers thinking out loud on their sites. I like it when my ideas’ competitors succeed.
