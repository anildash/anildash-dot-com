Just one of those great "Only on the Web" sites is the **[Visual Thesaurus](http://http://www.thinkmap.com/demos/visualthesaurus.html)** from a company called [ThinkMap](http://www.thinkmap.com).

I’m not much of a fan of Java applets, but this one’s worth the download time, it’s **a great brainstorming tool**. And one of my classic bookmarks, perennially on my favorites list.
