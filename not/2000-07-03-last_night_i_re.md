Last night I reached the **holy grail of music piracy**: I downloaded an entire album from Napster, converted it to .wavs, burned it to a CD, pulled down the cover from [CD-Covers.com](http://www.cd-covers.com/main.html), and popped the disc into my machine, where [CDDB](http://www.cddb.com)*actually recognized it as the original disc*.

Of course, this was all much easier due to my **vastly underdeveloped conscience**.
