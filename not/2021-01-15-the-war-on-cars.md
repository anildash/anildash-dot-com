I love any kind of advocacy for safer, more humane streets, so it was a real joy to get to guest on the wonderful [The War on Cars](https://thewaroncars.org) podcast. Doug Gordon went deep, really pushing into the connections and surprising resonances between what makes communities safe and healthy in both our built environments and in our online life.

And one of the fun parts about being a walking parody of myself is that, when I have conversations like this one, I get asked about Prince. Fortunately, I didn't even have to contrive a connection â€” Prince was a regular bike rider and routinely took advantage of the human-friendly street architecture in Minnesota, so I could share some fun stories about that, too.
