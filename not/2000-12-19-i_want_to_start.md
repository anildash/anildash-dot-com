I want to start my own company again. Ironic, since I started my last company in the same kind of precession economy that we’re in right now. But it’ll be cool!

It’s be like Razorfish, but without the razors or the fish! Like the Neilsen-Norman group, but younger! Like Apple, but not translucent! Hmmm, I’m not too good at this hype thing, but [who’s with me](mailto:anil@dashes.com)?
