One of the bad things about coming from a fuddy-duddy MIS background like I used to have is that the magazines and columnists in the industry almost uniformly suck. But one exception that I’ve mentioned before is InfoWorld’s Bob Lewis. Check out his [current column](http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/01/02/12/010212oplewis.xml) to find out why.

He always touches on ethics and intelligence and common sense and all those other great topics that most discussions of technology omit, and that all discussions of technology in a corporate setting deliberately avoid. Plus, he’s a good writer.
