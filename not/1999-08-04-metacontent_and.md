**From the silly to the sublime…** it seems the Internet brings out people’s interest in **Meta-Content** whether it’s [Slate](http://www.slate.com) or [Brill’s Content](http://www.brillscontent.com) in my [bookmarks](http://www.dashes.com/anil/bookmark/), or any of the other media analyses on the web, everyone wants to explain everything to everyone else.

This trend isn’t so surprising, but what is surprising is **how little of this content refers to the web itself**. But of course the point of today’s rant is that there are now self-referential web reviews, the first of which has tickled my fancy for quite some time: [GhostSites](http://www.disobey.com/ghostsites/). It’s an archive/homage to sites which have been abandoned by their creators, muddling along in HTML purgatory optimized for browsers which have long been superceded. And it’s funny, too.

A little more geeky and less accessible is [Area 404](http://www.plinko.net/404/area404.asp). If you don’t know, 404 is the generic error message a server would spit out to your web browser if the URL referenced a page that doesn’t exist. Being **exceedingly unhelpful**, the 404 on most sites these days has been replaced by (somewhat) helpful custom error pages. And herein lies the charm of Area 404, documenting the **best, worst, funniest, and strangest** of the 404 errors on the web. **Cool!**
