From [Getting It]([http://ss.gettingit.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic](http://ss.gettingit.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic) FTContentServer?GXHC_gx_session_id_FutureTenseContentServer=a3c918ce5f9204c5):

> Now **one of cell-phonedom’s most annoying novelty rings** has been sampled for an anti-cell phone CD released last week by dance act Solid Gold Chartbusters. “I Wanna 1-2-1 With You” is a steal from the catchphrase of one of the UK’s largest mobile phone network providers, and the video features a cell phone user being beaten and thrown into the Thames.

The cool thing about the Chartbusters is that it’s another **Jimmy Cauty** project. As someone who loves the media muckery of groups like Negativland and Chumbawumpa, Jimmy Cauty is one of my patron saints, having been a founder of [The KLF](http://quality.gconnect.com/KLF/). Also known as the JAMMs. Furthermore known as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. A.K.A. The Timelords. But I digress…

You can **hear the song**[here](http://the-raft.com/pieces/solidgold/rams/onetwoone.ram).
