Rex has compiled a fantastic list of [the Best Blogs of 2006 that You (Maybe) Aren’t Reading](http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-1825.cfm). I’m flattered to be mentioned as a see-also suggestion, but mostly I’m just happy that someone has created such a list and that it’s well-done. Not surprising, given that Rex is the king of lists, and maybe I won’t feel so bad about the fact that I haven’t gotten around to doing one of these myself.
