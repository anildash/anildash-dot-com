â€¦over on MetaFilter, they [have never heard of New Jack Swing, and think Living Colour was an R&B group](http://ask.metafilter.com/78930/Name-this-band-and-song). Now I can understand why they [flamed the shit out of me](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/03/do-you-want-lin-1.html) for [suggesting the site should have a white background](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/13786/The-Green-Should-Be-White). It would have been too redundant. (In the interim, that thread on MetaTalk has [officially become an in-joke](http://mssv.net/wiki/index.php/In_Jokes).)

Here, then, a list of things that are indistinguishable:
