Naturally, I’ve got a couple of blank CD-RWs lying around, but I only like to use CD-Rs. So let’s make it interesting: everybody post the cheapest price (you can post rebate or non-rebate prices, but I’m partial to not having to send things in) for either 50 or 100 blank CD-Rs, and if you find the best price I’ll buy one spindle for me and one spindle for you. What’ve you found?

Winner will be announced by Friday.
