Coincidence? Right after Columbine, the WB cancelled their episode of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* because of parallels in the high school violence theme. Now, shortly after the **explosion at a Michigan senior citizen’s home**, [NBC](http://www.nbc.com) shows an episode of *ER* which features a fire at a nursing home.

Now the question is, did NBC decide to be tasteless because it’s **sweeps week**, or is it merely our culture’s usual **indifference to the elderly**?

Either way, a surprising lapse considering how responsive the networks *try* to appear to public sensibilities. Or does this not count because it’s senior citizens instead of teens?
