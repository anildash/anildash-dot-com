Another follow-up to [blood diamonds](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/12/01/blood_diamonds): The New York Times offers [Hollywood’s Multifaceted Cause du Jour](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/movies/03sant.html?ei=5070&amp;en=96c76d8619236dc4&amp;ex=1165813200&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=print), Marc Santora’s look at Hollywood’s engagement in the marketing or unmarketing of diamonds.

> Diamonds are love. Diamonds are a girl’s best friend. Diamonds are forever.

Worth revisiting is the BBC story outlining [Al Qaeda’s use of diamonds](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2775763.stm) to help launder their funds, and [Cory Doctorow’s comment](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/12/01/blood_diamonds#comment-92832) on my earlier post, outlining [allegations against Warner Bros](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/23/warners_stiffs_afric.html), the studio that produced the Blood Diamond film. I’d caution that the [original gossip source](http://www.nypost.com/seven/10232006/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm) of the most damning quote is unsourced.
