Well, in a year of many firsts, here’s another one: I’m off to Taiwan for a week and a half. I”ve never been there, so I’ll be eating a lot and trying to enjoy everything I’ve read about. (Especially looking forward to Taipei 101, since I love skyscrapers.)

If you’ve ever been, or are a native to Taiwan let me know what I should be trying out or taking a look at. I’ll mostly be offline (this is a family trip, not work) but I hope to check in at least once or twice on email and the comments here to see what ideas people have. See you next year!
