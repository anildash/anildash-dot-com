I really like inside.com, and another reason why is [this great story](http://www.inside.com/story/Story_Cached/0,2770,6570_9,00.html) about some of the behind-the scenes purchases of memorabilia for the EMP.

Which reminds me, I’ve thought this for years… Paul Allen is, in many ways, the ideal of what I would be if I had been co-founder of Microsoft. Except no sports teams. And a Prince museum instead of Hendrix. And I’d dress better.

Okay, maybe I *wouldn’t* be like Paul Allen.
