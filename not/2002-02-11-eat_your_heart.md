Valentine’s Day is, of course, coming up. Get your sweetie an [anatomically correct heart-shaped gelatin mold](http://anatomical.com/item_disp.asp?PN=955021&amp;CAT_NBR=7&amp;PROG_NBR=0)! Or perhaps they’d prefer a [one pound solid milk chocolate version](http://anatomical.com/item_disp.asp?PN=SCH-4G&amp;sid=A021102). Eat your heart out.
