Today I saw [Hirata-san](http://uva.jp/dh/mt/)‘s new [Movable Type book](http://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/ASIN/4844318128/2020-20) in person for the first time, and I know it’s tacky to say since it’s about our company’s products, but the thing is just [beautiful](http://images-jp.amazon.com/images/P/4844318128.09.LZZZZZZZ.jpg).

Obviously, we’re big fans of the Japanese aesthetic here, but it’s still striking to me how much care goes into the design and packaging of media in Japanese culture. It’s one of the few books I’d buy just to have on the shelf as art.
