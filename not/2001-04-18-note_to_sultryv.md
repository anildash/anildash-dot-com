**Note to sultry-voiced telemarketer chick:** When I say your automotive discounts don’t appeal to me because I don’t own a car, what I mean is, **I don’t own a car**. I know it’s easy to just assume that I’m being my usual coy, teasing self. Or maybe you think it’s more of that cynical, rogue-with-a-heart-of-gold sarcasm that woos the ladies so. But it is not. No, indeed, there exists an [actual American city](http://www.greenspiration.org/Article/BigGreenApple.html) in which most people *don’t* own cars.

It’s not that I don’t appreciate the attention, because I do. But I just can’t see the need for roadside assistance when the vast majority of my travel is by foot, *on* those very roadsides. Please feel free to call back about other useless things any time, though. I can always tell by the mispronunciation of my name, and the fact that you’re asking for Ms. Anil Dash, that you’re calling Just For Me about a Very Special Offer.
