Pegged to the release of Depeche Modeâ€™s remix set, the Guardian offers [a history of the remix](http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1327023,00.html) that, predictably, skews white and British but is still pretty good anyway. Also, Depeche Mode: Please stop releasing the same songs over and over. I understand why that do that with Elvis, but you guys are still alive.
