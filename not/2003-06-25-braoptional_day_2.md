It seems, as in [years](http://dashes.com/anil/2001/05/braoptional-day.html)[past](http://dashes.com/anil/2002/09/braoptional-day-1.html), an annual summer tradition has returned to Manhattan. No better way to celebrate the end of the Month of Rain than with this sartorial tribute to our sweltering weather.
