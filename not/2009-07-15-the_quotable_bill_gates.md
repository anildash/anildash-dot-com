The two best quotes from Ina Fried’s [interview with Bill Gates](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10286732-56.html) today:

- On advanced science: “That’s right. We’re going to make the cows that don’t fart. You name it, we’ve got it under control.”
- On Google and his deep understanding of FUD: “[T]he more vague they are, the more interesting it is.”

Once you’re done reading that, enjoy a wonderful thing Gates has done: [Posting full-length, annotated videos of Richard Feynman’s best lectures](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/).
