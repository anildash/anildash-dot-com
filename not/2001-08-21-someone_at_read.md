**Someone at Readerâ€™s Digest is incompetent and ought to be fired from his or her job.** Their [unsubscribe page](http://www.rd.com/help/help_page.jhtml?helpid=prvy_optn&amp;title=Privacy+Options) requires you to *enter your name and address* in order to remove yourself from their mailing list.

This person should be sued by the company for having misrepresented himself as qualified and or sensible during his job interview. Die, morons, die.
