Since this has worked so well for me in the past, I’m going to ask for your help once again. I need to find a place to live, as soon as possible, here in San Francisco.

We’re looking for a pet-friendly one bedroom in SOMA/South Beach/Mission Bay/whatever you want to call it. If you know of a place, or have a hookup for some place that’s not on Craigslist, let me know. Cash prizes and rewards to anyone who finds a place that’s picked. Don’t let me down, blogfriends!
