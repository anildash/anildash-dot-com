I guess it was inevitable, there’s a [RSS feed](http://www.dashes.com/anil/anil.rdf) of this site available now, in RSS 1.0 format. I don’t know if anyone will ever use this, but I’m planning on doing some stuff with it later. And, just so ya know, it’s not a completely redundant feed of entries on this site, I’m a lot more selective. So that version might be more interesting than the full page here.

Do me a favor, [let me know](mailto:anil@dashes.com) if you use it. Just for my ego’s sake.
