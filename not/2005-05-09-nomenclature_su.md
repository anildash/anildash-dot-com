I think individual [user scripts](http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts) for [Greasemonkey](http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/greasemonkey-and-business-models/) should be called “[Smart Tags](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/smarttags/)“.

Everyone who switched sides on this one since 2001, please raise your hand. (For once, I get to smugly be consistent on this one.)
**Update:** Or, you know, [GreasemonkIE](http://www.daishar.com/blog/archives/2005/03/greasemonkey_fo.html).
