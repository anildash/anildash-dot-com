A follow-up on my eariler reference to [Google as a platform](index.php?blogarch/2002_04_01_archive.php#75054651), a system administrator reveals in a mailing list post that [Google will be offering an API](http://www.ruby-talk.org/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/37623):

I really hope they charge money for it. Especially if they do it as a pennies-per result web service. They’d help launch the entire infrastructure for such products, and it’d be a great additional revenue stream for them. Relevant info about their [refinement of the Google business model](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/08/technology/ebusiness/08GOOG.html?homepageinsidebox) is available over at The Paper That Shall Not Be Named.

Google side note: Didja know that [Page Rank](http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html) was named after Larry Page, not HTML pages? It’s true. There’s also a less lengthy, easier to understand, less interesting [explanation of Page Rank’s function](http://www.goodlookingcooking.co.uk/PageRank.pdf), done by a third-party researcher.
