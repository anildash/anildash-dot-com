So, uh… yeah. We had [an earthquake here](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/10/27/national/main316096.shtml) last night. I was on Instant Messenger with my friend in LA at the time:

> **Friend In LA (1:39:21 AM)**:whatcha doin’
> **Anil Dash (1:39:31 AM)**:i am watchin’ P. Diddy
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:39:40 AM):??
> **Anil Dash (1:39:44 AM)**:And I am infinitely more funky than this man.
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:40:06 AM):who is P. Diddy
> **Anil Dash (1:40:22 AM)**:you’re joking.
> **Anil Dash (1:40:28 AM)**:Puff Daddy?
> **Anil Dash (1:40:32 AM)**:Sean Combs?
> **Anil Dash (1:40:35 AM)**:Bad Boy?
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:40:48 AM):I know who Puff Daddy is
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:40:55 AM):who calls him P. Diddy
> **Anil Dash (1:40:55 AM)**:these are all the same man
> **Anil Dash (1:41:04 AM)**:he calls himself that, now
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:41:08 AM):I know
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:41:11 AM):really
> **Anil Dash (1:41:13 AM)**:🙂
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:41:21 AM):why
> **Anil Dash (1:41:24 AM)**:Far be it from me to deny the man his name
> **Anil Dash (1:41:35 AM)**:also, it’s the name of the song
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:41:53 AM):huh
> **Anil Dash (1:42:17 AM)**:the video, it’s called “DIDDY”
> **Anil Dash (1:42:57 AM)**:what the fuck….
> **Anil Dash (1:43:12 AM)**:the building here just shook
> **Anil Dash (1:43:25 AM)**:we don’t have earthquakes
> **Anil Dash (1:43:29 AM)**:maybe it’s the wind
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:44:06 AM):haha
> **Anil Dash (1:44:09 AM)**:something very abnormal is going on
> **Anil Dash (1:44:20 AM)**:my first thought is that a plane must have hit something nearby
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:44:37 AM):you’re scaring me
> **Anil Dash (1:44:47 AM)**:yeah, i was kind of scared myself
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:44:47 AM):what’s happening
> **Anil Dash (1:44:55 AM)**:i don’t know
> **Anil Dash (1:45:04 AM)**:it must just be some weird wind thing
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:45:11 AM):is the building still shaking
> **Anil Dash (1:45:13 AM)**:no
> **Anil Dash (1:45:17 AM)**:it was just for like 10 seconds
> **Anil Dash (1:45:30 AM)**:hmm
> **Anil Dash (1:45:38 AM)**:everything looks normal outside
> **Anil Dash (1:47:14 AM)**:hmm
> **Anil Dash (1:47:31 AM)**:must’ve just been the wind
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:47:43 AM):some wind
> **Anil Dash (1:48:04 AM)**:yeah
> **Anil Dash (1:48:17 AM)**:there was a big windstorm earlier
> 
> ****Friend In LA (1:48:25 AM):huhq
> **Anil Dash (1:48:28 AM)**:maybe it just hit the right speed to make the building shake
> **Anil Dash (1:50:49 AM)**:well, that was odd

I am thinking now that all we need to finish the items on the End Times checklist is a plague of locusts.
