I just heard fighter jets fly by overhead. I haven’t heard that at night since September. Haven’t even thought about that since I saw some back in November when Flight 587 went down.

I guess some parts never go away…

**Update:** As [this story](http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/41842.htm) attests, I apparently was not alone. (Thanks to [John](http://www.johnwehr.com/johnwehr/index.html) for the link.)
