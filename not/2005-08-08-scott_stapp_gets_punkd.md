Why do I love LiveJournal? Because you find things like "[Who’s your favorite faux Christian ex-rock star?](http://www.livejournal.com/users/tomluv/13923.html)". A sad tale of Scott Stapp’s decline into c-list tail-chasing. Proceeds from the sale of Denny’s Grand Slam Breakfasts do *not* go to the [Arms Wide Open Foundation](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/07/14/although_im_na).
