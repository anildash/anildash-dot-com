Well, if it’s time for me to be away at SXSW again, then that must mean I make up for my lack of updates by reposting the [Panda Joke](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/03/09/panda_joke) for the fourth (!) year in a row:

A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders a sandwich. He eats the sandwich, pulls out a gun, and shoots the waiter dead. As the panda stands up to go, the manager shouts, “Hey! Where are you going? You just shot my waiter, and you didn’t even pay for your sandwich!”

? “Hey, man, I’m a PANDA!” the panda shouts back. “Look it up!”

The manager opens his dictionary and reads:

> **Panda:** A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin, characterized by distinct black and white coloring. Eats shoots and leaves.
