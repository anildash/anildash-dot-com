I’m at the [Personal Democracy Forum](http://www.personaldemocracy.com/) here in New York City today, and considering how many technology-related events I go to, I’m surprised that this one already seems to have piqued my interest. If you’re at the event, drop me a line, and stop by [the panel I’m speaking on](http://pdf2007.confabb.com/conferences/PDF2007/sessions/5556/details) in the afternoon.
