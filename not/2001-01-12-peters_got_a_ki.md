[Peter](http://www.peterme.com/)‘s got a kick-ass rant basically pointing out that those that can’t do, criticize. This kind of writing reminds me why Peterme was the first blog I read regularly and one of my biggest motivations for starting my own. He also tipped me off to Blogger back when it first came out.

But he still don’t have permalinks for his entries, goddammit!
