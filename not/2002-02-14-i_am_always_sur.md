I am always surprised at what things get huge responses… People have been emailing me like crazy about the “links in new windows” thing. Let me clarify: I’m not saying people *shouldn’t* be able to open links in new windows. Why, that’d be crazy! I’m saying that it’s not a default behavior, and it shouldn’t be *forced* upon users. If they’re advanced and want to do something else, let ’em. But don’t force it on the rest of us who want to control our browsing behavior.

**Update:** For what’s it worth, here’s how I surf. I tend to right-click on any link on a page full of interesting links, and open the target in a new window. Then, on the last interesting link, I just click on it, so that window will be reused. I go through each of the new windows, reading and closing as I go, until I’m back to my original window, which has loaded the new page while I was reading. On sites where I know a new window will be spawned, I just drag the link to my URL bar to make the browser ignore the new window target for the link.
