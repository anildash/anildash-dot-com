God*damn* Dean is a good writer. I just discovered [Cardigan Industries](http://www.cardigan.com/) and [Textism](http://www.textism.com/) and I feel almost angry that no one brought them to my attention sooner. Where have they been all my life? It’s the same sense of loss I had when Grant resuscitated [World New York](http://www.worldnewyork.org/) but I didn’t know about it until a while later.

The loss being, I had spent days of my life without this great work to look at, to soak in. So much to read, I just want to download the whole damn thing and trot my laptop out to Central Park and soak it all in and have the pedestrians and retirees wonder why I’m laughing.

You should try doing the same thing. If you need directions to the park, just ask.
