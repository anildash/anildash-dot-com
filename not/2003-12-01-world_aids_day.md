Today is World AIDS Day, and for the fifth year I’ll be participating in [Link and Think](http://linkandthink.org/). Originally inspired by the "Day Without Art" observations of World AIDS Day, Link and Think is a great chance for the online community to show its support for those living with AIDS and to educate all of us about the impact of AIDS while we hope for a cure.

I’ll be posting additional links relevant to the day on the sidebar under the Daily Links.
