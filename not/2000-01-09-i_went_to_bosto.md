I went to Boston over the weekend, more on that later, but their entire downtown roadway system is being rebuilt as part of a project called **The Big Dig**, obviously located on the web at [BigDig.com](http://www.bigdig.com/home5.htm).

Check it out, itâ€™s kinda neat. Makes the downtown look hellishly ugly, though.
