I’m very, very proud to work with people like Jamison. Take a look at [his post describing the new sign](http://www.adventuresinurbanliving.net/2005/sep/08/the_constructive_post.php) that was put on the New Orleans streetcars here in San Francisco. Jamison had a clever and thoughtful idea about how to take advantage of the distinctive transportation to encourage people to make donations. Just a few days later, it’s reality.

And even though the sign is brand new, its presence has already had an impact on people who were directly affected by the hurricane, including [one of our coworkers](http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2005/09/a_streetcar_named_relief) who sits just a few feet away.
