After reading [Dan’s recommendation](http://www.dansays.com/archives/index.asp?date=2/15/01#1086), I tried out SideStep for booking my flight to SXSW. He’s right, it does have a convenient interface, but I was a bit leery because it had some monstrous installation that larded no fewer than *six* SideStep icons on my machine. Those are all safely deleted, and now I’m happy again.

Of course, I used their wizard to find the cheapest price, then I went to Priceline anyway. And Priceline gave me the same flight I had found on SideStep, but forty bucks cheaper. Cha-ching!
