Taking [press nothing](http://www.0sil8.com/episodes/pressnothing/index.html) to its next logical step, [Jason Freeman](http://music.columbia.edu/~jason) has made a [Tellme voice remixer](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/25/arts/25ARTS.html) that will take your Shakespeare quotes and sing ’em back to you.

Strange that there’s no mention of the [*other* Jason’s](http://www.kottke.org) little project.
