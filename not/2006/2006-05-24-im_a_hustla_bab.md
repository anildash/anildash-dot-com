Hmm, much as I love Valleywag, there’s some factual inaccuracies in the [loving tribute](http://www.valleywag.com/tech/anil-dash/from-the-vault-six-apart-vp-spammed-for-a-job-175895.php) posted about me today. It asserts that a Vault.com story says that I was trying to spam people with my resume when I was out of work before [joining Six Apart](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/04/23/i_work_for_six_).

But, if you refer to my [note at the time](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/05/16/yeah_well_when_), you can see the story’s actually from [early 2001](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/01/31/i_didnt_lose_my), well before Six Apart or even Movable Type existed.

The context is kind of important, since this was right after the (first?) dot-com bubble burst and it was a rough time to be in technology in NYC. But a few lean months later I got my job at the [Voice](http://www.villagevoice.com/) and all was well.

As I said in the comments on Valleywag, you’re *goddamn right* I was emailing every person I could about finding a good job. I was also blogging like crazy, writing some of my best stuff. And I was trying to go out and meet new people too, since I really didn’t know anybody in the industry. Those tactics might seem old-fashioned now that every kid with a PowerBook thinks he can make something to flip to Yahoo, but I still think they’re a good idea if you want to establish yourself. It’s only five years later and some anonymous somebody is spending his time searching for my name on Vault instead of finding a better job. There’s a lot more I’d like to accomplish before I’d consider myself a success, but I take no small satisfaction in having gone from nowhere to somewhere over the past five years.
