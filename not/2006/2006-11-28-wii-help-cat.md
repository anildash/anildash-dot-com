The [Nintendo Wii](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009VXBAQ/2020-20) is an amazing and magical device that, for the last week, has left my heart full of joy and my sad geeky arm sore and full of pain. But perhaps the most charming thing about this wee electronic device is [the Help Cat](http://www.cabel.name/2006/11/tragedii.html).

As [Cabel’s video](http://www.cabel.name/files/2006/11/Wii%20Help%20Cat.mov) beautifully demonstrates, a small animation which makes an everyday function become a frustrating and mystifying experience can somehow entertain an entire roomful of adults. This, truly, is magic. I don’t want to go on at too much length about my enjoyment of the Wii; It strains my relationships with my friends and coworkers who don’t yet have one. Instead, I’d advocate checking in on [Hello, Nintendo](http://hello.typepad.com/hello_nintendo/) or checking out all the [Wii action on Vox](http://www.vox.com/explore/posts/tags/wii/).
