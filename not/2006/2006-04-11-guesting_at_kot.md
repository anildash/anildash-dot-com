Though Jason demanded asked me to contribute to his site a while ago, I’ve been remiss in actually posting links. However, if you bop on over to [Kottke.org](http://www.kottke.org/) you should find a number of his Remaindered Links are supplied by me. (Look for the “ad” after them.) This is for all those people who email me asking me to bring back my Daily Links. Damn, I forgot how much *work* this stuff requires!
