From the comments on one of my recent posts, here’s a perfect example of the challenge of explaining technology. I’d provided a [set of links](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/12/subscribe_a_lit) for subscribing to my site.

From “[AbC](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/12/subscribe_a_lit#comment-39238)“:

> I hate something about this whole feed business. I see techies falling over themselves trying to use the simplest possible language to help the rest of us understand what feeds really are and how they work. It’s like a lot of people dumb down the definitions and try to use terms they think we’ll understand and be able to internalize.

> Tell me exactly how these things work … tell me a feed is like an HTML file that has the address/URL of where a site’s latest content is posted and that you can specify exactly how you want to see the new content – snippets or full blow-by-blow.

> I maybe wrong … because techies are really muffling the real definitions with their softened, purpotedly easy to understand definitions.

I think AbC’s wrong. Here’s why, courtesy of [Joanne](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/12/subscribe_a_lit#comment-39592):

> Thanks for posting this. I’ve heard of RSS before, but it all seemed like black magic until I tried out bloglines. Your post inspired me to get started!

No offense, but somehow I find the argument (and potential readership) of the Joannes of the world more compelling.
