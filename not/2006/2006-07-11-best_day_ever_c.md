I nominate [Chris Anderson](http://www.longtail.com/) for best day ever. A [hit book](http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/07/we_did_it.html) on its first day out ([my review](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/10/a_review_long_t) got a [nice nod](http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/07/launch_day.html)), a [featured blog](http://featured.typepad.com/blogs/2006/07/the_long_tail.html) on TypePad (and you get a copy of the book if you [sign up](http://www.typepad.com/)), and now [Boing Boing sez](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/11/conde_nast_buys_wire.html) that Conde Nast [finally owns Wired News](http://wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,71366-0.html?tw=wn_index_2).

I can’t imagine what it’s like to edit one of the most award-winning print magazines around and then [catch shit](http://www.valleywag.com/tech/chris-anderson/editor-dooms-wired-magazines-site-to-fugliness-183486.php) for the fact that the website is written by a different crew. Let’s see if Best Week Ever recognizes the milestone and gives Chris a shout-out.
