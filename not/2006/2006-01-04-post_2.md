Best things I’ve seen lately?

- A [wake-up call for geeks](http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1888986,00.asp) who have been neglecting the legislative initiatives that will affect all of us in the future.
- The latest [rant against betas](http://www.publish.com/article2/0,1895,1905917,00.asp), which I only agree with insofar as the term “beta” has become meaningless for those of us who might want to actually make use of the term for our products.
- A consistent set of [POP failures in Gmail](http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-POP-and-Forwarding), which have gone remarkably unreported.
- Flickr proving themselves, once again, the [best lemonade-makers in the business](http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#121). They’ve made “please try again later” seem downright friendly.
- I’ll link to it again: [KartMatch](http://kartmatch.ning.com/), the tracking app for Mario Kart DS friend codes. It’s the first Ning app useful enough to make me lament the service’s downtime.
- Dahlia Lithwick, the best legal writer who writes for laymen, [explains why following the law is a good thing](http://www.slate.com/id/2132983/), for those who’ve forgotten.
- The NY Times explains [the tyranny of cute](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/03/science/03cute.html), an effect we probably already would have known if we could watch TypePad’s server logs since the launch of [Cute Overload](http://cuteoverload.com/).
- Just for myself, the post I wrote on the company website about [Fortune 500 companies using Six Apart tools](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/01/fortune_500_blo.html). There’s actually at least a dozen more that aren’t listed, but I always forget most people don’t know about these.
- And finally, [Fark Photoshop Monitor](http://64.81.51.213/fpm/index.html). It’s a trap!

More to come later, including (hopefully) a wrapup of my trip to Taiwan.
