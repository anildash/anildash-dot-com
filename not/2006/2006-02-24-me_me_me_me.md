Now, if I were a good blogger, I’d write posts about subjects that I know nothing about. But I am a rank amateur, so I will focus on my area of expertise: me.

Even better, I won’t show off how great I am at writing about myself, I’ll just link to others, in order to demonstrate that I am your one-stop, go-to guy for the latest breaking news and information about me.

First, [an interview with me](http://mahangu.org/2006/02/dots-and-dashes/) that Mahangu did the other day. Nothing too earth-shattering, but I think it came out nicely.

Not satisfied with text? Want to hear my dulcet tones? Behold, [an audio interview](http://blogbusinesssummit.com/2006/02/blog_business_s_16.htm) (I think the kids call them “podcasts” nowadays) with me about the stirring topic of business blogging. It’s a good preview of some of the stuff we’ll be talking about at the [Blog Business Summit](http://www.blogbusinesssummit.com/seminars/).
