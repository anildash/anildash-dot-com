In the same week I missed Etech for the first time in years, I should also mention that I’m *not* going to be in Austin for South by Southwest for the first time this millennium. My apologies to everyone who I’d hoped to see, but the combination of having been fighting off a persistent cold and being pretty [busy at work](http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2006/03/using_blogs_to.html) means that I can’t make it to Texas this year. And yeah, that means no KICK!

Sorry to everyone who’s disappointed, and have fun at the panels and parties. Make sure to enjoy the Boiling Pot on my behalf.
