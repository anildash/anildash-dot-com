Right now, the most important thing you could be doing is reading these web pages:

- Jeff Clavier [celebrates his second blogging anniversary](http://blog.softtechvc.com/2006/07/software_only_i.html) and quotes me quoting Jeff Veen quoting Lane Becker. It’s a good post nonetheless.
- [Dean](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2006/07/dean.html). That would have been stretched out into “Deeeeeeeeean!” but then we’d have a Dean Scream issue.
- [Linux sucks, Apple sucks, and Popularity Isn’t Everything](http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/07/linux_sucks_apple_sucks_and_po.html). Dan Zambonini is right up my alley:

> It’s that if you want high traffic — the Holy Grail for most web sites — then *write something controversial*. Don’t bother with in-depth research or well-considered arguments — just find a couple of topics which people care passionately about, and drive those people crazy. **It’s the future.**

- Not entirely unrelated, [the market share myth](http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/1052F769-AC24-4892-8937-E3E90BCFD5CC.html).
