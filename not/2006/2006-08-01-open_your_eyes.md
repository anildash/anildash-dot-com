- Why are half the pizza joints in New York City named Ray’s? I think A Full Belly had [the definitive answer](http://www.afullbelly.com/2004/03/new_york_pizza__1.html) to this question as part of a [series of pizza posts](http://www.afullbelly.com/2004/03/new_york_pizza_.html) a few years ago. Much more illuminating than the New York Times’ [brief telling](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/nyregion/thecity/30fyi.html/partner/rssnyt?_r=1&amp;oref=login) of the story.
- PC World has been doing [interesting A-B testing](http://blogs.pcworld.com/techlog/archives/002468.html) of potential cover designs, and I’m struck by how close the results are, almost 50-50 right from the beginning.
- Q: [What if Jakob Nielsen had a blog?](http://usability.typepad.com/jakob_nielsen/) A: The colors would be based on his outfit.
- [Christopher Hitchens on Mel Gibson’s anti-semitism](http://www.slate.com/id/2146880/):

> This is not just proved by his twistedly homoerotic spank-movie The Passion of the Christ, even though that ghastly production did focus obsessively on the one passage in the one of the four Gospels that tries to convict the Jewish people en masse of the hysterical charge of Christ-killing or “deicide.”

- Prince’s soon-to-be-ex-wife Manuela is [saving the children by selling candles](http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/columnists/story.html?id=dec7d318-04b6-4276-b973-b9690a2066dd). Though there are some minor details incorrect in the story, it gives me hope because I remember when she was just another fan hanging out in the newsgroup with the rest of us nerds.
- Some [kind words](http://tojou.blogspot.com/2006/07/why-people-use-blogs.html) from Mindy McAdams. Her thoughts about local journalism online remind me to direct everyone to this [great interview with Adrian Holovaty](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/060605niles/) about combining geekery and journalism. Which he does better than anybody.
- And if you’re still not sick of [Wikipedia analysis](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/31/antiwikipedia_l), the good folks at the Atlantic have sent this link to [The Hive](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia), an exhaustive look at Wikipedia and its culture. Set aside half an hour of quiet time to really dive into the piece.
