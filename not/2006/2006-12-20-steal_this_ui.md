Summary: Earlier this year, I said that [Office 2007](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/06/19/office_2007_is_) is the bravest upgrade ever, and the reason was simple: The audacity of introducing a radical new user interface was as surprising as the vast improvements it yielded in productivity. Now, Microsoft has decided to [license that user interface to other developers](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa973809.aspx), being surprisingly open in the license terms and potentially improving the user experience for dozens of other applications.

When I [wrote about Office 2007](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/06/19/office_2007_is_) back in June, the benefits were obvious to me:

> They killed the File menu, along with all the other menus. They added a giant, weird circular target up in the corner. They actually use part of the title bar as a menu sometimes. They even changed the default font in all the apps. What’s amazing is not just that it works, but that it works so well.

> My experience has been the same as most of those who I know that are using the new version: Word went from being frustrating and confusing to fairly straightforward to use. PowerPoint went, in a single upgrade, from being the worst widely-available presentation software to being the best. Excel is a fundamentally different kind of spreadsheet application, focused on presenting information usefully instead of optimizing for the creation of complex formulas.

Anne Chen and Michael Caton wrote an [excellent overview of Office 2007](http://www.serveriq.net/print_article2/0,1217,a=196017,00.asp) in eWeek, and I don’t know if they or their editor created the headline, but it gets to the gist of the story pretty effectively: **“Office 2007 Will Rock Corporations’ Worlds”**.

Though the [Office UI Licensing page](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa973809.aspx) is a little short on details, as always, Jensen Harris articulates the story perfectly [on his blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/11/21/licensing-the-2007-microsoft-office-user-interface.aspx):

> [M]ore than a year ago we started talking about how we could share the design work we’ve done more broadly in a way that also protects the value of Microsoft’s investment in this research and development.

> Well, I’m pleased to finally be able to definitively answer the question. Today, we’re announcing a licensing program for the 2007 Microsoft Office system user interface which allows virtually anyone to obtain a royalty-free license to use the new Office UI in a software product, including the Ribbon, galleries, the Mini Toolbar, and the rest of the user interface.

[![Office 2007](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/office-2007.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HCVR30/2020-20)(Side note to Microsoft’s communications team: I understand you feel you need to put out the standard [boring press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/nov06/11-21officeui.mspx), but why not at least *link* to Jensen’s blog from there, so that people reading about this won’t think it’s quite so boring?)

The best part is that the guidelines themselves are written in clear English. You can [download a sample](http://officeblogs.net/UI/Preview%202007%20Microsoft%20Office%20System%20UI%20Design%20Guidelines.pdf) (1.4mb PDF) of the 120-page guidelines document. The example guidelines are about an esoteric area, resizing the items on the Ribbon toolbars, but are clear, comprehensible, and promise a lot of potential for the other pages in the document.

This is a fantastic trend, mirroring on the desktop what companies like Yahoo have done with licensing their [UI libraries](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/) for the web. I’m cautiously optimistic that other developers might even follow the guidelines correctly, promising some productivity gains from the new generation of desktop apps.
