Hey, everybody, [Dawson](http://www.dawsonspeek.com/archives/000212.php#000212) says, “Sometimes you just have to decimate a ‘people’.” Ain’t that grand! I presume he means we ought to kill women and children, too, as that’s part of decimation. But this advocate of violence against an entire people is on the *good* side, so it’s okay.
