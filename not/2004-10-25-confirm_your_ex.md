Looking to surround yourself on election night with a circle of like-minded individuals who won’t challenge your existing political beliefs? Just check out Fundrace’s [Block Party](http://www.fundrace.org/block_party.php)!

Though I kid about the political intentions of people who cliquishly join up on election night, the application itself is really cool, a good combination of location-based web services and smart UI. Nice work.
