Great post from a musician’s point of view about the whole Napster debate over at Prince’s site called [COMMENTARY: 4 The Love Of Music](http://www.npgonlineltd.com/freedom/news/200007294theloveofmusic.html).

Incidentally, there are not one, but *two* really good blog-type things for online Prince fans, and they’re good enough that even non-fans might be able to stomach them. The first is the official, and therefore cryptic and precious, [Paisley Transmissions](http://www.npgonlineltd.com/news/paisleynews/), and the second is the fan-run (and therefore concise and useful) news blog at [Prince.org](http://www.prince.org/news/). Neat to see the form being used so well…
