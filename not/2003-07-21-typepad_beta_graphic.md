Another minor milestone for me is the [new TypePad beta badges](http://authgeek.typepad.com/authgeek/2003/07/revised.html) that are popping up. It’s really exciting to see people connecting with each other through the service already! You can grab the graphic and put it into a links TypeList to put it on your own site.

I’m getting so impatient, I can’t wait until everybody can jump into TypePad and be part of the little community that’s forming.
