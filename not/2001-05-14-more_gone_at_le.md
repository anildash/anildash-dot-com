More gone, at least for now: [Loobylu](http://www.loobylu.com/) and [MegNut](http://www.megnut.com) and [Alison](http://www.bluishorange.com/) and hell, [Peter](http://www.peterme.com) and [Lane](http://www.monstro.com) barely update anymore anyway. And [RCB](http://www.rebeccablood.net/). And me, I guess.

Reminds me of that tradition in print media where the onset of summer causes a week-long haitus in publication. But, perhaps, a bit more ominous. But I have an idea to get myself out of the funk.
