I have always been of the belief that being a geek trumps ideology, and that anybody who’s a wonk or an information junkie will always side with others of their kind, even when there is a difference of opinion. This theory is borne out by [Newt Gingrich’s glowing review](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/A27WFYW9ZJ5DN1/103-4495290-3423038?main=reviews&amp;review-id=046500971925001004576471) of *The Next Deal*.
