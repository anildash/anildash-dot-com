I had the chance to [interview Paul Lindner about Gopher](http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2006/08/digging_up_info.html) on the Six Apart site, and his answers were fantastic. In case you can’t tell I’m a Gopher fanboy, it’s all out there on the page. A nice bonus link that came from working on that post was [this BBC history of the web](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5242252.stm), which I also enjoyed.
