A lot of times my friends stop me and ask me why I carry my [man purse](index.php?blogarch/2001_05_01_archive.php#3515983) all the time. I tell them it’s because it makes it easier to keep my camera with me wherever I go. Then they ask me, “But you’re a lousy photographer, why do you always need to have your camera?” And I tell them that I need to be able to document the things that I see, as proof that they exist.

Like yesterday, when a man wearing a suit and tie and a yellow backpack tethered a stationary bike to a street sign in the middle of the road (At Cooper Square, for those of you who know New York City) and mounted a rear-view mirror on the sign post and began pedaling leisurely, sometimes taking a drag off of the cigarette in his hand. He did this for about an hour.
