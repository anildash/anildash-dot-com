Thanks to Gael of [PCJM](http://www.popculturejunkmail.com) for mentioning me in the new [Striblog](http://www.startribune.com/viewers/qview/cgi/qview.cgi?story=81927967&amp;template=column_weblog_a), and then being nice enough to send me an email to let me know about the mention…

Oh, and welcome to the [Camworld](http://www.camworld.com) readers, too…
