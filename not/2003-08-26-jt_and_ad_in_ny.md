I am really, truly, inordinately excited about the fact that I’m going to see Justin Timberlake perform this week, especially since it’s not the crappy arena tour with Aguilera, but one of the live club gigs he does with a real band. If this sort of revelation does not trouble you, you may enjoy my [TypePad site](http://anil.typepad.com), where I’m going to quarantine most of my pop-culture related revelations from now on.
