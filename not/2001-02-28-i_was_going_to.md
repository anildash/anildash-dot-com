I was going to complain that my friend [Jon](http://smile_sessions.blogspot.com/) uses too many big words, but then he started talking about *professional wrestling* and I remembered that he may actually be dumb.

The nice part is, he and I are friends, so I can just say that. The bad part is there’s another site I really, *really* want to link to which actually is written by a genuine dumb guy, but it’d just be rude.
