I have received the following comments on posts from my [Pop Life](http://www.anildash.com/poplife/) blog. Though they’re ostensibly aimed at the celebrities I discuss on the blog, I prefer to think they’re aimed at me.

> I love you sooo much.I love your music, your style, and eveything else about you. I am very happy for you. i love your clothes i think they are very hott and sexy. well i want to congradulate you and i want u to know that *ALL YOUR FANS LOVE YOU BUNCHES* Keep up the good work and good luck in the future *love ya*

Thanks! I am pretty proud of my clothes.

Again with the clothes! You’re gonna make me blush.

I’ll do my best! I bet you look great in my clothes.

> [i think you need your head examined or something](http://www.anildash.com/poplife/2004/01/a_film_to_forge.html#c4212308).. because mandy is not another britney spears or christina aguilera it doesn’t mean that she is not good in what she is doing (acting and singing) she has real talent! And in the end she did win britney spears in the 2002 MTV movie awards for Best Breakthough Female fir her role as jamie in a walk to remember..

> A walk to remember influenced alot of people (including me) to do something good and change their way of thinking!!

Oh, wait, hmm. That one actually *was* aimed at me. It’s true, though, my feelings on Mandy Moore *do* justify a psychological exam.

Well, usually I go by “Anil”, not “Nelly”, but I’m not picky.

If people ever start being web-saavy enough to understand the difference between a post *about* someone and a post *by* that person, it’ll be a sad day.
