What the hell ever happened to **vCards**? Weren’t they supposed to become really ubiquitous? My recollection is that all the major PIMs support them… is there anything for the Palm that exchanges them?

In case you want to revive this dead standard (it’s not even an XML-based standard… how *90’s*!) you can go [make your own vCard](http://www.vicintl.com/vcf/generate.htm).
