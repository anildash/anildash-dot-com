So, after never having changed my design, I finally did it. It’s been literally years with the old design, and it wasn’t until I looked at my site the other day that I realized **how badly it needed to change**. If I had stumbled across a site that looked like mine, I would have been disinclined to stay around to read it. Hopefully that’s less true now.

[What do you think](mailto:anil@dashes.com)?

What amazes me is that I’m [one of the oldest blogs on Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/directory/dateCreatedDirectory_69.pyra), and I didn’t even use Blogger when I first heard about it to update my site. Please give me critiques, I’ve got a lot to fix on this page…
