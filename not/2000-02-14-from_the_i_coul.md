From the "I couldn’t make this up if I tried" department, Guess who’s visiting my office this week? [Luther "Luke Skyywalker" Campbell](http://www.xyno.de/luke/luke.html). Now I just have to figure out **what I should get him to autograph**. Perhaps I should play [this](http://www.comedyradio.net/act/rock/rock.chris-luther.campbell.html) for him. Find out more about his genius [here](http://www.altculture.com/aentries/t/twolivec.html).

**I have found a kindred spirit.** There exists a web page for another Luke fan, please visit it [here](http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Dunes/3943/). Be sure to click all the links!
