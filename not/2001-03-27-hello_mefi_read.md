Hello, [MeFi](http://www.metafilter.com) readers. The IE6 sidebar thingy is [here](__GHOST_URL__/tools/mefibar.reg), and once you download it, you’ll need to double-click on it to add it to your Registry. It’ll ask you for confirmation, and you can just say yes, because **you can trust me**!

Much thanks to [Matt](http://a.wholelottanothing.org) for all the great work he does on MeFi. And his boyish good looks. Why, I tell ya, that boy oughtta be doing magazine covers! Easy, breezy, beautiful– Haughey!
