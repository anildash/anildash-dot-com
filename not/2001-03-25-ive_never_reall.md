I’ve never really had a "link list" on my page like a lot of sites do. I have a little database thingy that pops up a few blogs in a sidebar, and then I cruise through those. But [Chason](http://chason.nulldesign.com), in an uncharacteristic act of self-promotion, asked me to link to his new design. (Which *is* pink, by the way. Where as my site is *not* pink, you bastards.) So I figured, in addition to linking to him, I’d put my list of links up on here, too. There’s lots more sites I visit frequently, but most of them are on my [portal](__GHOST_URL__/portal) already.

If you read this site, you probably already know most of these. Hell, if you read this site, you probably *write* one of these sites. But enjoy the ones you don’t know. And please, feel free to [let me know](mailto:anil@dashes.com) what I’ve forgotten. There’s a couple I can think of already…

Here, then, is my List of Links:

Hmm. I thought there were more than that.
