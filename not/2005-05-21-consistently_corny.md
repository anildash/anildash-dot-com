From [Rolling Stone’s 1977 interview with George Lucas](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/7330268/starwars):

> 
> "Oh, my God, what a stupid, old-fashioned thing and how corny can

> And Johnny did too, a little bit. A lot of the lines in the movie

And then later, "Not only a slightly corny dialogue here and a very simplistic, sort  
 of corny plot… *Some of Mark Hamill’s lines are pretty  
 corny.*" Well, at least he’s consistent.*
