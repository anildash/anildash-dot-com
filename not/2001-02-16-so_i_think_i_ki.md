So I think I kinda want to do [this job at Lego](http://www.lego.com/info/jobsspecific.asp?JobId=340). Anybody want to take care of the application/interview process for me? There ought to be a way to outsource all of that stuffâ€¦

And what about the possibility of an employee discount on Mindstorms? The mind reels!
