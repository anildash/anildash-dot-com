So naturally I am back at the parents’ homestead in Pennsylvania, and I found it interesting that the local mall had something that I’ve **not seen anywhere else**, not even in oh-so-progressive Manhattan or user-friendly California: **reserved parking for pregnant women** next to the handicapped parking spots.

What a great idea, well executed, and bravo to [Crown America](http://www.crownamerica.com), the mall’s managers, for implementing this prime example of a good user interface.

Thumbs down, however, for not having a website up. Duh, what if I wanted to find a Crown American mall in my area?
