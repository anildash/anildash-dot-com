**Why was the Internet invented**? So that we could have [Fabrice Morvan’s homepage](http://www.fabricemorvan.net/fmhome.html). Fab, of course is the more talented (and still living) half of Rob & Fab, the artists intermittently known as **Milli Vanilli**.

Did I mention I have all of their albums, under all their names? I’m pretty proud of that.
