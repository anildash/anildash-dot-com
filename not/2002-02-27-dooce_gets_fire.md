Hmm. [Heather](http://www.dooce.com/02_26_02.html) got fired from her job ’cause of her weblog. This, despite the fact that her site absofuckinglutely rocks. Depressing. Worse, the only reaction I had was to wonder how long ’til [Cam](http://www.camworld.com/) points out that he [did that first](http://www.camworld.com/screwed/), too. Heh.
