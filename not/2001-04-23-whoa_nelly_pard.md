[Whoa Nelly](http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1443020/20010420/furtado_nelly.jhtml?headlines=true). (Pardon the tired joke.) I’m actually excited about a multi-act tour for the first time since the first Lollapalooza. Moby’s got Nelly Furtado on the list that already included himself, the Roots, Incubus, New Order, Outkast, Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold and presumably many more to come.

I didn’t get to go to the first Lollapalooza because they canceled the concert I had tickets to. I am still very bitter about this. Perhaps better luck this time. And let’s hope Moby’s Area: One doesn’t go downhill as rapidly as Perry Farrell’s effort did.
