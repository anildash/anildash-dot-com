If you don’t [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/anildash), you’ve been missing out. But fear not! I take care of my loyal blog readers as well, by offering you the highlights of the interesting links I’ve been sharing there:
[![HAHA LOL](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3505633439_87d4bc5519.jpg?v=0)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alaina/3505633439/)

- “[I find it bonkers, by the way!](http://bit.ly/mootroll)” That’s Rick Astley in his tribute to moot, as part of the Time 100 package. He’s specifically referring to the the Obama rickroll video, but I think it applies in general.
- “[If you love something, charge for it. … People will pay for things they value.](http://bit.ly/lovecharge)” My esteemed colleague Andrew Anker makes the case for being unashamed of your value. (Semi-related: Four years later, [my post on how freelancers should price their work](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/05/pay-by-the-hour.html) remains one of the most popular things I’ve ever written.)
- [Focus on the Family reviewed Prince’s tepid new release](http://bit.ly/focusflower) and decided that even reactionary late-career Prince isn’t tame enough for them. I would pay to see them review *[Dirty Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00122OTSE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=2020-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00122OTSE)*.
- “[In the U.S. people view names & identities as absolute things … but in China, identities are more amorphous.](http://bit.ly/englishname)” It’s a bit of an over-generality, but overall this Slate piece on names and identity was terrific. I tend to like Slate articles, though.
- [Arsenio looks askance at his own Wikipedia article](http://bit.ly/arseniopedia). I wish they would air classic episodes of the Arsenio Hall Show or screen them on Hulu or something; I’d watch them.
- I pimped the MP3 of [James Brown’s “Talking Loud and Saying Nothing”](http://bit.ly/talkingloud) because it’s a shame that so many people have never heard the whole thing.
- Nate Silver’s [TED talk about race and heterogeneity](http://bit.ly/culdesac) is pretty strong throughout (though the reach of some of the conclusions exceeds the grasp of the data), but I most enjoyed the point about 8 minutes into the clip where he talks about the implications of cul de sacs in (sub)urban planning.
- There are [photos of lots of people wearing Aretha Franklin’s big grey bow](http://bit.ly/greybow) from the Obama inauguration. Most are photoshopped, but the best are not.
- Joel Spolsky gets to the heart of why B&H is a New York institution: “[The whole operation is a crazy Willy Wonka factory.](http://bit.ly/joelbh)”
- The organizers of the National Day of Prayer (you missed it last week!) have one of their key campaigns focused on [praying for the media](http://bit.ly/npdmedia). It seems to be working as well as prayer usually does.
- I liked the new Star Trek movie, though it felt a little bit like when the eye doctor looks at my retinas. Just as enjoyable was [this excellent look at Trek food](http://bit.ly/trekgrub), which has as its only shortcoming the regrettable omission of “Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.”
- Genius illustrator Christoph Niemann’s venerable [Periodic Table of Metaphors](http://bit.ly/metaphors) is always worth another look. It’s funny because it’s *true*!

This world wide web thing, i think it’s going to work out. I think it’s gonna be good for the both of us. As always, “HAHA LOL” is courtesy of Alaina Browne.
