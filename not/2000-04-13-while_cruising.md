While cruising around voting for various Webbys, I realized that some ratings schemes **don’t translate well**, particularly in [this category](http://www.webbyawards.com/peoplesvoice/category_ballot.html?catID=24)…

Because [this screen ](images/mahir1.gif) and [this screen](images/mahir2.gif) seem just plain absurd to me. **No offense, Mahir.**
