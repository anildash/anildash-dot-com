This is another [Anil](http://www.badminton.ca/profiles/kaulani.html), not me. But what he and I share in common is an amazing proficiency in badminton. Most people don’t know this, but I’m amazingly good at this one pathetic sport. It’s especially hard to believe for those who know my disdain for sports in general.

Don’t believe me? Well, c’mon over and bring some birdies: **I’ll kick your ass.**.
