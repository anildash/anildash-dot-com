One of the most formidable advertisers we deal with at work are the good people behind [Liberator Shapes](http://www.liberatorshapes.com/). They sell products designed to improve your sex life, apparently. While I am unclear as to what advantages the Cube provides over, say, a *chair*, I still have to concede that their pricey products are certainly entertaining to shop for.

Even if you don’t need a flat piece of foam like the Stage, you’ll want to take some time to explore the site. Don’t miss the [E-Cards](http://www.liberatorshapes.com/ecard.html). Father’s Day is coming up, ya know!
