I know a lot of people who are either professional developers or have some development background. So I asked around as to what’s considered the best merchant account system to work with. The things I’d look for were robust developer tools, a reasonable transaction fee, reliability, and promptness of payment. Yet it seems like *nobody* is doing this job right.

There are lots of fly-by-night places you wouldn’t trust a customer’s credit card number to. Then there are big old banks with exorbitantly high rates and zero technical ability. Then there’s the hit-or-miss PayPal experience, where your customers have to jump through hoops to pay you, and you have to *actually send money* to people if you want to test the system out.

Has anyone ever had a good experience with this stuff?
