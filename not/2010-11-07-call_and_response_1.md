Lots of nice writing out there that either replies to or references some recent posts here. Highlights:

- [Dictatorship Versus Democracy](http://www.fastcompany.com/1697038/battle-of-the-app-store-models-dictatorship-versus-democracy) in app store politics at Fast Company, by the always-genius Gina Trapani. A clear contrast between Mozilla and Apple’s approaches, and the [many other app stores](http://dashes.com/anil/2010/10/all-the-app-stores.html) that use similar models as well.
- Slashdot (remember that site?) [picked up the conversation](http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/10/22/1931211/Beware-the-Garden-of-Steven) about an [open app store](http://dashes.com/anil/2010/10/how-to-make-an-open-app-store-on-the-mac.html) with a few insightful comments on the thread. It was more striking to me that I wrote a post that got Slashdotted, and *didn’t notice*. Valleywag predictably went a little darker on this topic, as Gawker’s Ryan Tate offered up “[Beware the Garden of Steven](http://valleywag.gawker.com/5669083/beware-the-garden-of-steven)“.
- After I posted a small catalog of app stores here, [ReadWriteWeb took the idea and ran with it](http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2010/10/developers-can-you-take-your-mobile-app-somewhere-else.php), asking developers, “Can You Take Your Mobile App Somewhere Else?” Good question!

Did I miss any other good responses? Nothing’s more satisfying than seeing people use ideas here as raw materials for their own work elsewhere.
