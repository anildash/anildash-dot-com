Benjamin Hestley [seems to think](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7392541/) that saying something “was one of the causes” of something leaves the impression that it “was the total cause” of that result.

Is Benjamin dumb, bad at set theory, or deliberately misreading something because he’s an apologist for slavery? You decide!
