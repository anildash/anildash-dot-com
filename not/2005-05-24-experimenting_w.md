Just because I like to try new things out, I threw Google’s [AdSense for Feeds](http://services.google.com/ads_inquiry/aff) on my Atom feed that lots of you are subscribed to. I’ll probably take it off, but if you want to fuss in the meantime, you can come to this post and flame me in the comments.

I think it’s pretty cool the AdSense markup generator gives you the template tags for your Movable Type or TypePad blog. Handy!
