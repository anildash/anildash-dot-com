So, I made [vague reference](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2000_12_01_archive.php#1716569) to the idea before, but this time I’m serious: There needs to be a geographically-distributed consortium of web developers, who can all network with one another to create sites or projects.

I know for a fact that there are a lot of truly talented, gifted artists and programmers (and those damned lucky people who are both) who are going to be back on the job market, and I think we should all work together.

Maybe informally cross-sell each other’s services, maybe just be "on the bench" if we’re ever in need of another person on the team during crunch-time before a deadline…

Obviously, this is only half-thought-out, but there’s a seed of a useful idea here. [Water the plant](mailto:anil@dashes.com).
