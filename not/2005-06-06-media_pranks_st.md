National Spelling Bee entrant [Dominic Ranz Ebarle Errazo](http://www.spellingbee.com/05bios/222.shtml) had apparently [slipped in a Napoleon Dynamite reference](http://obscurestore.typepad.com/obscure_store_and_reading/2005/06/did_anyone_else.html) during his brief appearance on TV, and then he showed up in the comments on Romeneskoâ€™s Obscure Store blog on TypePad to talk about it. Well done, Ranz!
