One of those interesting side-effects of having lots of old blog posts around is that sometimes they come back to life. With [Star being fired](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060514/ap_en_mu/dj_arrested_16) last week, there’s been a whole bunch of new visitors and commenters to my old post which states, correctly, that [Star and Bucwild can kiss my ass](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/01/12/star_and_bucwil).

And since, naturally, their [own site](http://www.starandbucwild.com/) offers no content *and* no place for people to have a discussion, it seems like the only forum for the conversation is blogs like mine, even though my site isn’t really about these clowns at all.

At any rate, I’m certainly not sad to see this no-talent get fired, but I do think it’s always interesting that individual blog posts can essentially become mini-sites, where conversations go on forever. I’d seen that in the past with my own post about [diamonds](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/01/20/diamonds_are_fo), and on other people’s blogs in examples such as [Jason’s post about *The Matrix Reloaded*](http://www.kottke.org/03/06/own-conversation). Now I’m curious to see the next conversation that wanders onto my old posts.
