In **an auspicious sign**, this morning I *finally* managed to start off my month by saying [Rabbit, Rabbit, Rabbit](http://www.harrumph.com/010731.html). (In what is probably a regional variation, I was taught to say it *three* times. Heather says it only twice, but Iâ€™m not one to tempt the fate of stupid superstitions.)
