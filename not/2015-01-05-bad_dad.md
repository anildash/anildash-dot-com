Even though I’ve been having a lot of conversations recently about [being a dad](http://dashes.com/anil/2014/11/peak-dad-twitter.html), the truth is that on any given day what keeps me up at night is the things I’m getting wrong. I know every parent makes mistakes, and logically I am able to keep that perspective on it, but I also know every parent can recite the failings that make us feel sick to our stomachs just thinking about them.

So I should be clear that the reason I’m always thinking about parenthood and its obligations is *not* because I think I’m World’s Greatest Dad, but because it’s an unusual duty where those of us who take it on *never* really feel like we’ve mastered it.

It was with that spirit in mind that I went into the conversation with Kathryn Rotondo for the [Motherboard podcast](http://www.motherboardpodcast.com/episode-12-anil-dash/) the other day. Typically, Kathryn speaks to women who are managing careers in technology while also raising their children. As a bit of a departure for the podcast, I was asked to give a little bit of a dad’s perspective.

Kathryn picked out a quote that I hadn’t quite realized was going to be a bit of advice to myself, a perspective that I’m trying to remember is true:

> The only bad choice is for you to be a miserable parent, to not be present, to not be investing time as much as you can in your kid, or to not meet those basic needs—the biological-level needs.

The goal, as always, is that maybe each of us can screw up our kids just slightly less than the generations that came before. If you have a few minutes, I hope you’ll give the podcast a listen (you can also [get it on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-12-anil-dash/id834761944?i=329745177&amp;mt=2)) and then offer your advice. Now I just have to figure out where I misplaced my kid…
