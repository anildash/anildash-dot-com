**Some good news:** At [Damien](http://www.mrbarrett.com)‘s behest, a gathering of New York webloggers (and friends). You can get [all the info here](http://newyork.evite.citysearch.com/respond/view/titleOnly?iid=BMFBKTTXYCDJYDHFZOVY&amp;closeJSHeader=OK&amp;previewAfterSend=ok), and this is an open invite to all in the community who want to attend.

It’s time to live a little, get out there and take our city back. The venue may be subject to change if things below 14th Street are still blocked off, but we’ll find a great place regardless, I’m sure.
