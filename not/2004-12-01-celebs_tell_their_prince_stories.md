GQ has a range of different celebrities [fawn over Prince](http://us.gq.com/features/general/041123feco_03). From Jermaine Dupri: "I remember when I was 8, Prince was opening for Rick James, and my mother was getting baptized, but she had to see Prince, so we left church early so my mom could see him."
