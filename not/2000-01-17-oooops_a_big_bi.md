**Oooops!** A big, big apology to all the Netscape 4.x users who visit, I just found out the site hasnâ€™t been coming up for a few days because I had played with the CSS for the site. And a huge thank you to [Damien](http://www.mrbarrett.com) for troubleshooting it and pointing it out to me, please everyone **click through to his site** and visit his excellent blog as a thanks for him helping me out.
