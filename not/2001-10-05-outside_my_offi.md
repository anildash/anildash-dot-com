Outside my office today and yesterday, the wind had shifted again. It still smells like That Tuesday when I leave work. The smell also lingers, appropriately, underground in the dark in the subway tunnels. I don’t ever want to smell that odor again. I sometimes have a dark, illogical worry that it won’t ever go away.

I was cleaning up my bag that I carry with me, and I found my air filter face mask, took that out today. I haven’t used it since the week of the attacks; I figure I don’t need it anymore.

It’s been twenty-four days.
