I was really depressed by the comments on [this post that Robert Scoble made](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/04/17.html#a9890) until I read the comment by [Mobile Jones](http://www.mobilejones.com/), who I think stated the point perfectly.

Until people stop being defensive, Iâ€™ll comfort myself with the thought that making the assumption that a market or conversation ought to be exclusionary is its own punishment.
