When there’s no time for original content, we link! These are the places I’ve popped up lately, or things that caught my eye:

- We published our [initial results from the Grand Challenges initiative](http://expertlabs.org/2010/05/grand-challenges-the-first-results.html) over on the Expert Labs blog, including a full data set of responses. If you’re a data hacker and can think of ways to analyze or present this data, **please help out**! Gina Trapani has also been leading the community in making huge strides with the [ThinkTank platform](http://thinktankapp.com/); It’s well worth checking out and joining the mailing list if you haven’t.
- Alex Howard reports on [how government works better with social media](http://mashable.com/2010/05/10/social-media-government/), offering five ways that the U.S. government is using social media to deliver services or engage citizens in making better policy.
- Mark Drapeau also described [the three phases of Government 2.0](http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/05/the-three-phases-of-government.html), including the transition from today’s experimentation to tomorrow’s solutions.
- Both of those pieces were written in anticipation of this week’s [Gov 2.0 Expo](http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010), where I’ll be making an appearance [on Thursday afternoon](http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010/public/schedule/detail/13854) to talk about crowdsourcing and participation, and how we bring startup-style innovation to the government realm. I’d also recommend [Susannah Fox’s list](http://e-patients.net/archives/2010/05/gov-2-0-expo-health-geek-guide.html) of what to see at the conference.
- I’ll also be expounding on the topic of startup-style innovation for government at the [Personal Democracy Forum](http://personaldemocracy.com/pdf-2010-day-one-schedule-june-3rd) next week. Between Gov 2.0 and the PDF event, I’ll be providing a lot more insights into what we’ve learned from our first initiative at Expert Labs, beyond just the data set I linked above.
- Finally, I was really pleased with how well [my talk at Fast Company’s Innovation Uncensored event](http://www.fastcompany.com/video/government-in-the-digital-age-how-anil-dashs-expert-labs-is-speeding-democracy) went a few weeks ago. You can see a summary of the conversation on the link there, or just watch the highlights here (though you’ll sadly miss some of the gratuitously baroque animations I’d littered throughout my presentation):
