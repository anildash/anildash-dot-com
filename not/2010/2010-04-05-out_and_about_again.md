Just [a few weeks ago](http://dashes.com/anil/2010/02/out-and-about.html) I made a list of some places that I’m speaking or appearing in the coming weeks and months, and here’s an update on a few of those. I hope folks will come up and say hi, or find time for a conversation, if you plan on being at any of these events. (And a special thanks to Clay Shirky; having a chance to speak with his ITP class on Friday night was inspiring and invigorating, making all these other presentations something I’m really looking forward to.)

- Tonight! The [NY Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/calendar/12961814/). After six years, I’m *finally* doing my first-ever presentation of an app at the Tech Meetup, unveiling [ThinkTank](http://thinktankapp.com/) as an introduction to the mission of [Expert Labs](http://expertlabs.org/). If you can’t make it, [this TechPresident interview](http://bit.ly/tpelns) I did with Nancy Scola should give you an idea of why I’m so excited.
- [Twitter’s “Chirp” developer conference](http://chirp.twitter.com/) on April 14 in San Francisco. We’ll be talking about how to use platforms like Twitter as a power for social good, and I couldn’t be more delighted to be a voice for that concept. (Psst… I might be doing some [improvisational presentationizing](http://dashes.com/anil/2008/03/video-makes-it-real.html) at Chirp as well.)
- Fast Company’s [Innovation Uncensored](http://innovationuncensored.com/) conference, April 21 in NYC. Finally, you get to see me and Ashton at the same event. Magical and revolutionary!
- I’ll be speaking at the [USA India Business Summit](http://www.usaindiabusinesssummit.com/) in Atlanta on May 10-11. This one’s really a change of pace for me, but I’m really optimistic about this new event providing a much-needed forum for a truly fascinating new era of business between my parents’ home country and my own.
- A keynote at [Gov 2.0 Expo](http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010/public/schedule/detail/13854), on May 26 in Washington, D.C. I’m thrilled to be talking about how we can bring startup-style innovation to the service of public good, and there’s no better place to have that conversation than the Gov 2.0 event.

There are a few other events that I know will pop up on the calendar; I’m looking forward to [Blogging While Brown](http://bloggingwhilebrown.com/) and to catching up with a bunch of folks at Foo East, though I guess it’s bad form to mention that? I dunno. I also *don’t* think I’m going to the 140 Conference, Google I/O or Facebook F8, unless somebody lets me know that I should be there. Regardless, I’m looking forward to meeting a lot of you in person! As always, email me at [anil@dashes.com](mailto:anil@dashes.com), send me an @anildash message or DM on Twitter, or leave me a message at +1 646 833-8659 if you’d like to get hold of me when at an event.
