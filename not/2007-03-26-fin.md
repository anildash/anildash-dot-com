I’ve found some interesting articles around the web recently that mention me or my blog, and while I don’t try to be comprehensive in linking to everything that mentions my name, I thought these were compelling enough on their own to be worth reading.

- Ross Mayfield’s [Twitter Tips the Tuna](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/03/twitter_tips_th.html). I think the title is an unfortunately awkward parallel to “jumping the shark”, but the title is the only part of the piece that’s off — the rest is really great. Ross has already done a few posts about Twitter’s popularity and I’m glad to see someone who knows what he’s talking about become the go-to guy for quotes on a new web technology. Ross’ post references my own [Consider Twitter](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/02/14/consider_twitte).
- Jason Calacanis, [More proof that there is no A-list](http://www.calacanis.com/2007/03/19/more-proof-that-there-is-no-a-list-or-at-least-if-there-is-it/). Inexplicably, I’m on there mentioned as an A-list blogger. The whole “A-list” meme was tired back in 2000, but now it’s kind of sweetly anachronistic to even talk about it. For what it’s worth, my blog is far less popular than it was at its zenith of readership, and the blogosphere is far more crowded. So I don’t know how useful I am as a data point, except to note that yes, I was “a low-level webmonkey at the Village Voice” before my current job, and that, yes the barriers to entry are lower than some people imagine them to be. Four years ago, when my blog *was* still relatively popular, I wrote [Beyond Power Laws](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/02/13/beyond_power_la). The post reminds me that I used to be a snob about LiveJournal before I started using it and loving it, but it also featured some tips on how to make your blog popular:

> - Consider having started your site in 1998 or 1999
> - Know a whole lot of people and consider becoming real-life friends with people who have popular sites or are involved in the media
> - Get on TV and in newspapers as frequently as possible to promote your site, because those really help drive traffic
> - Make sure to insist that you are smart and attractive if you can’t actually demonstrate those traits through your site

- Jeremiah Owyang has a [list of Asian technology speakers](http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/03/20/asian-technology-speaker-roster-an-ongoing-list/). It’s an interesting effort, but I’ve seen people over the definition of “female” on lists of female technology speakers — I don’t envy the task of defining who belongs to the diaspora of the largest continent on Earth.
- And saving the goofiest for last, [Blog Spring](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/posts.html?pg=3) in Wired: “Look! There’s Anil Dash of dashes.com”. Here I am!
