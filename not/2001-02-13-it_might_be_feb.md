It might be February and miserable outside, but my purely qualitative analysis is that it’s **springtime on the World Wide Web**. Not just that romance is fully in bloom, but intriguing and compelling things like [{ citystories }](http://www.citystories.com/) are taking shape.

I can’t wait to see what [Cam](http://www.camworld.com) does with [NY Stories](http://nystories.net/). Derek asks on the CityStories site, "What city do you love?" and I can have only one answer. I fear it’s not unique, in fact it’s trite enough that the thought has its own jingle: **I Love New York**.

As the reluctant romantic in me has been waking up these past few weeks, (did I mention I’m listening to Stevie Wonder again…?) I find myself returning to one of my first true loves, which is the city I live in. Aren’t you jealous?
