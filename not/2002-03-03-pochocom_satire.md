From [pocho.com](http://www.pocho.com/):

> This year’s Scammy Awards, the world of music’s top honors, featured the highest level of invisibility of top Latin talent ever. Even with stiff competition from Asian/Indian musical artists (together, representing over half of the world�s population), Latin artists still walked away with the highest invisibility of any ethnic group.
