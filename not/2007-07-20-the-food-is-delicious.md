Former New Yorker Joshua Schachter’s captured his [New York Essentials](http://joshua.schachter.org/2007/07/new-york-essentials.html), the short list of places you can’t afford to miss when visiting NYC. *Every single one* of the places he lists is a restaurant; He correctly asserts that if you only have a short period of time to visit the city and you used to live here, the thing you truly miss the most is the food. I found it interesting that Joshua landed on “transcendent” as the best description of Shake Shack’s burgers — I always use the same word to describe them myself.
