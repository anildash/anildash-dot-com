Why do I like [David](http://www.netwert.com/ideapad/2001_10.html#16)? Because he, like me, recognizes the power of Lionel Richie. Again, please note: This is not “Ironic Lionel Appreciation”. This is the Real Thing, baby. Current favorite Lionel Richie song? *Do It To Me One More Time*. All-time favorite? That’s easy: *Easy*.

This is why I love the web. When I spend weeks not updating my site, I can substitute other people’s work for the actual effort required to keep this site updated.
