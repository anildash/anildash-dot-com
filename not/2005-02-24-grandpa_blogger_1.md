The proof I’m getting old is that Alison is [marking her fifth year of blogging](http://www.bluishorange.com/?x=2005_02_01_archive.html#110913944227030133) and, instead of appreciating all the great work she’s done, I’m thinking, “I still think of her as one of the new kids who showed up, like [Ernie](http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&amp;y=archives/2000_07) or [Mena](http://www.dollarshort.org/archives/2001_05.shtml).”

Why are the first real posts on Ernie’s and Mena’s blogs both about going to Vegas with your *parents*. I think this either says a lot about my circle of friends or what it took to have a good, funny blog a couple of years ago.

I was a *normal* kid. When I went on vacation with my parents, we went to Atlantic City. Alison’s [oldest posts](http://www.bluishorange.com/?x=2000_02_01_archive.html) don’t explicitly mention going to Vegas with her parents, but I’m sure I could read that into them if I just thought about it hard enough.
