Well, at long last one of my pet projects **went live today**, it’s the new [Suddell Builders](http://www.suddell.com) website.

Of course, websites are never *done* and there’s a million things I don’t like about the site, but the only measure I can use is whether it is better than the old one. And I think the answer is yes. Please [email me](mailto:anil@dashes.com) if you have any suggestions.
