This is probably **the best correction notice** I’ve ever seen on an article, from Rolling Stone’s [interview with President Clinton](http://entertainment.msn.com/music/features/clinton_interview.asp):

> CORRECTION: Due to a transcription error, the words “don’t ask” were printed in the latest issue as “dumbass” in our interview with President Clinton. We regret the error.
