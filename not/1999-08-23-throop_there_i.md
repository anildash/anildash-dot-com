Thanks to the design excellence and automotive auspices of the [Ford Motor Company](http://www.ford.com), I am in scenic **Throop, Pennsylvania**. Yes, this town is exactly what one would expect of a location named Throop.

Of course, this is not just another bellyaching session about my temperamental **1993 Mercury Sable**, this is a chance to explore the suburbs of Scranton, PA. I had an extremely helpful towtruck driver named Joe who not only went out of his way to drop me off over here at a [Mickey D’s](http://www.mcdonalds.com) but also gave me his **home phone number** in case I needed to reach him, or to dispose of my car. And then before dropping me off he apologized for **not having any cash** to give me to get a cup of coffee.

Now *that’s* good people. And no, I didn’t have the heart to tell him I don’t drink coffee. And you wouldn’t believe how rural Pennsylvanians react to a notebook computer and a handheld in a fast food restaurant… you would think I carried a bomb in or something.
