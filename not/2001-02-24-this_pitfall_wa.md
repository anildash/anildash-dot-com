This [Pitfall walkthrough for the 2600](http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/a2600/file/pitfall.txt) was a godsend. Don’t use [this guy’s crappy one](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~awwatkin/ATARI/2600/pitfall.html), it’s just not worth the trouble. What amazed me was the the good version there was just written a few weeks ago.
