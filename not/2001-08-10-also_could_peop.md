Also, could people start linking to me with my name again? Like, “Hey, [Anil](http://www.dashes.com/anil/) is cool!” or something? Because I lost my [Google lock](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=anil) on the word [Anil](http://www.dashes.com/anil/) again, to those damned French housing people.

I hate when they take the lead. But I’ve stolen the Google search from them before, and I plan to do it again.
