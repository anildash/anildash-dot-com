I [*told*](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_07_01_archive.php#4706027) you there’d be **more bots**. Meet [MemePusher](aim:goim?screenname=memepusher&amp;message=hi). He only works with MetaFilter right now, but there’s more to come. All of this courtesy of [Andre](http://www.torrrez.org), because he is a genius.

Naturally, all the usual beta bugs apply. And keep your eyes open for [MemePusher.com](http://www.memepusher.com), once I get off my ass.
