Once you’ve reviewed the [guide to Beck and Scientology for journalists and fans](http://www.lermanet.com/beck/), it becomes clear why he disses prescription drugs in his (otherwise excellent) [new video for "Girl"](http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1502628/05192005/beck.jhtml). As [Andy](http://www.waxy.org/) points out, if Scientology gets any more popular, we’re going to be seeing Spring Break SEA ORG live from the cruise ship in a few years.
