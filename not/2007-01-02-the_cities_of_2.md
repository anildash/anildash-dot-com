After seeing the lists made by a [number](http://www.onfocus.com/2006/12/3896)[of](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2006/12/24/my-year-in-cities-2006/)[friends](http://www.kottke.org/06/12/my-year-in-cities-2006), I thought it’d be fun to post my own record of the cities I visited in 2006. I believe the canonical rules state that only cities where I spent the night count, and cities that were visited on more than one discrete trip are designated with an asterisk. Thus:

- Anchorage, AK
- Aspen, CO
- Boston, MA
- Camp Hill, PA
- Cary, NC *
- Chicago, IL *
- Dallas, TX
- Half Moon Bay, CA
- Las Vegas, NV *
- Los Angeles, CA
- New Orleans, LA
- New York, NY *
- Phoenix, AZ
- Portland, OR *
- Sacramento, CA *
- San Diego, CA *
- San Francisco, CA *
- Santa Monica, CA
- Sausalito, CA
- Seattle, WA
- Taipei
- Washington, DC *

Some of those are really exceptional because of the sheer number of times I visited (I live in San Francisco, and visited NYC five times this year, Vegas four, and Sacramento and San Diego three), so I realized the final tally put me in a new city, on average, every other week. I think I’m justified feeling tired about 2006 and happy to be in 2007.
