About 10 years ago, in what seems like a different lifetime, I was considering attending [MIT](http://www.mit.edu). At the time, that wasn’t even an entirely unreasonable goal. Since then, life started happening with its usual disdain for advance planning, and I ended up with the wonderful, but radically unexpected, life that I have now.

The natural tendency, though, is to wonder “what if?” some times. I have to hope that the alternate-universe me ended up working on something as cool as Cameron’s [Social Networks Explorer](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/socnet/index.asp?ego=dashes.com/anil).

It’s a cool add-on to the work that he’s already done for [Blogdex](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/socnet/).
