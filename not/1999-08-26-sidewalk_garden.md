An almost surreal **New York Moment**: we were at a pizzeria at the corner of York and 79th, and there was a fellow *watering his garden* outside the shop. Not amazing that there was a gardener, but that the "garden" was the small square of dirt around the base of a tree that was planted in the sidewalk.

This guy actually had **strings and stakes** holding up the flowers in this space that was probably 3 square feet. Pretty cool!
