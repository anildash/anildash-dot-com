My October 12 ’99 [peeve](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?peeves.php) was a short, ineloquent attempt at conveying the message [conveyed by this essay](http://www.jejune.net/chunks/008.html). And though I already emailed her to compliment on it, I have to mention it again: Katie has an absolutely *gorgeous* design. The kids these days, with their excellent writing and their elegant designs….

Sigh.
