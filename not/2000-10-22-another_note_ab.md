Oh, one other note about **symbolic links in Win2K**, there has *always* been a way to make them through the UI, but it only works in one specific location: You can drag any folder onto the Start Menu and a full, working symlink (or, as it’s formally called in NTFS 5, a junction) is created that results in a hierarchial cascading folder off of your menu. It’s how the My Documents folder under "Documents" works.

I find it pretty handy to have things like the **Inetpub** folder hanging off my Start Menu. I know there’s lots more places I could use this, but I’ve found that I have tended to move my folders around in such a way that I have been able to do without it so far. Kind of how Mac users carefully plan their task switching so that it doesn’t make their MP3’s skip.
