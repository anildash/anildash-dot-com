For the **Clueless Executive** in your life, Microsoft presents their [Tech Glossary](http://www.microsoft.com/enterprise/glossary.htm). It’s surprisingly even-handed without the usual MS slant.

Although I find it a little disconcerting that I knew all of the terms’ definitions duing my quick perusal of the page… **Note to self**: Find out about this "Having a Life" concept. Perhaps there is a website on it?
