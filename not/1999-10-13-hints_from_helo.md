Itâ€™s kind of strange to me that **one off-hand reference** to *Hints from Heloise* has resulted in a peculiarly large number of visitors from [AOL Search](http://search.aol.com) looking for the [real Heloise website](http://www.heloise.com/).

Now is it just me, or were Heloise and [Samantha from *Bewitched*](http://www.heloise.com/) switched at birth?

(Coincidentally, one of my new obsessions is finding **new uses** for [Baking Soda](http://www.armhammer.com), but it *predates* my references to Heloise.
