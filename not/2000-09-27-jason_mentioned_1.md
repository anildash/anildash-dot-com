[Jason](http://www.kottke.org) mentioned [E-Quill](http://ink.e-quill.com/index.html), which is really similar to an idea I had, but I wanted to take advantage of Flash 5â€™s ability to work outside of a bounded rectangle, so that the annotations would be vector objects.

Either way, much better than Third Voice.
