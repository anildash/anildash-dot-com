A brief trip to [Atlantic City](http://www.atlanticcity.com) reveals that the city is as **tacky and depressing and overdone** as ever. However, [Sands](http://www.acsands.com/)‘ $15 buffet proved formidable enough to fell **three grown men**. The scariest realization I had while there is that I have spent 3 or 4 Christmas mornings in Atlantic City. Agh.

Vegas remains the **tackiest place on earth** by a long shot, though, so don’t worry. By the way, I do mean *brief* trip– we left at 7:30p and I was in bed by 7:00a, with 7 hours of that being travel time.
