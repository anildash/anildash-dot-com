When Star Wars fans wanted to use elements of the Star Wars universe in their fan films, even incorporating story or character elements from unreleased films, LucasArts responded by [having a fan film contest](http://www.lucasfiles.com/index.php?s=&amp;action=feature&amp;id=7) in conjunction with one of the biggest fan community websites.

And this was from a company with one of the most valuable brands and stables of intellectual property in the whole world. On the other hand, some companies like to [harass fans for being fans](http://www.scottandrew.com/main/entries/001156). One of these tactics is sustainable in the long term. One is not.
