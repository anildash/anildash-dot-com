Every once in a while, the random shuffle kicks up "Breathe On Me", off of Britney’s [*In The Zone*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000DD7LB/2020-20), and the song makes me terrifically sad, even though it’s not that bad.

Why, you ask? Well, because this song is clearly the sound of Mark Taylor’s failed aspiration of getting a track on a Kylie Minogue album. I can just imagine the conversation. "Well," he sighed, "Kylie’s people called, and the ‘Breathe’ track got cut from the album. Guess we should call Jive and see if they want it for Britney. *sob*"

Chin up, Mark! It still sounds just like it would on Kylie’s album. Unfortunately, as with all Britney tracks, it would have sounded better as an instrumental.
