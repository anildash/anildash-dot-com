Waitaminute. Dan put up a little [anecdote about his Amazon account](http://www.lakefx.nu/archive/2001_02_04_index.html#2306496), and there’s a wish list link in it, but clicking on the link took me to *my* wish list? Something peculiar there.

Dan, my friend, that’s *not* the way to beg for goodies in a subtle manner. And no shameless money-grubbing like on my site, either.
