I enjoy links myself, so I thought you might want some too. Here, then:

- [Graphs as art](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/07/graphs_as_art.html): Werner Vogels picks up the site graph meme with some nice visualizations of Amazon and A9.
- [Knowing enough to be dangerous](http://q.queso.com/archives/001972): Bad advice about Windows tweaking, debunked by Dr. Jason, who’s never happier than when he’s correcting misinformation.
- [Flickr tag count comparison](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/photo/flickrTagCount.html), where Nelson finds out what *doesn’t* influence interestingness. Highly recommended if you enjoyed [infographics about Flickr massages](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/19/massaging_the_d).
- The response to the Mumbai bombings has [been rather hushed](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003568.html). Both the attacks and the lack of discussion have been on my mind, Sepia Mutiny covers the topic well.
- [Bomani Jones on Prince’s best work](http://www.bomanijones.com/2006/07/20/15.22.35/index.html). I find myself in violent disagreement with the some of the assertions, despite being in complete agreement over the conclusions.
- Tim O’Reilly with [four big ideas about open source](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/07/four_big_ideas_about_open_sour.html). Especially compelling to me because, improbably, I’m [keynoting](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9526) (is that a verb?) the O’Reilly [Open Source Conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/) in Portland next week.
- And then, finally, [Concerning the platinum bitch](http://oh.destructo.org/?p=12). I’ve been meaning to write a post about Khia for about two years; Stephen beat me to it and now I don’t have to.
