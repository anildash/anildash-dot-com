So, Slashdot’s staging server lists [Journals](http://banjo.slashdot.org/journal.pl) as a new feature. They’re apparently blogs that are hosted on their server. This only makes sense if they’re still pursuing some kind of page view-based model. Unfortunately, their hosting costs are only ever going to go up as their user numbers increase. But, *hey*, their business model’s not my problem!

Strange that Blogger, LiveJournal and Userland get a competitor in Slashdot. Go browse some sample journals at their (rather meager) [Top 10](http://banjo.slashdot.org/journal.pl?op=top) list.
