Just another reason to like [Brill’s Content](http://www.brillscontent.com) is this excellent package on the [Mega-Media companies](http://www.brillscontent.com/features/bigmedia_1299.html). It’s terrifying to read, but an excellent example of **what journalism should be**.

**Bonus**: Just another example of why **David Duchovny is cool** was the reminder I got from the [Brill’s article](http://www.brillscontent.com/features/experts_1299.html) that he is **suing Fox** because they’ve screwed him out of his fair share of X-Files royalties by selling the syndication to FX real, real cheap.

On another media-reviewing tangent, damn, [this](http://www.houstonpress.com/issues/current/hostage.html) is entertaining.
