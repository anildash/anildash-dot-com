[Cam](http://www.camworld.com/dvd/) owns "When Harry Met Sally" *and* "You’ve Got Mail" on DVD. Now, I will even go so far to admit liking "You’ve Got Mail" but he own *both* these movies?

I’m hoping it’s just a case of him having too much disposable income to spend on DVD’s. If not: Ladies, I’ve got a sensitive, romantic guy who’s a leader in his field and widely respected.

And Cam’s available too.
