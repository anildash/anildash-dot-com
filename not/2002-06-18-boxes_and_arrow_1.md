Wow, I’ve been working on an essay about Vannevar Bush’s "As We May Think" for a while, but a lot of the points have already been covered by an article over at [Boxes and Arrows](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/002719.php). Kinda takes the fun out of it. Although I disagree with some of the reverence for Bush’s work, prescient though it was, [Erin](http://www.emdezine.com/designwritings)‘s done a terrific job overall.
