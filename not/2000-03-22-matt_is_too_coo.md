[Matt](http://www.haughey.com/) is too cool for me. First he hooks up with the [Pyra](http://www.pyra.com) folks, then he reveals his [love of Brasilian music](http://www.metafilter.com). **Sigh**. If only he were female…

But seriously, [Jason](http://www.kottke.org) points out [a really cool site](http://www.lineto.com/01linetofonts/02linetographic_fonts/lego_fontcreator.html) which I think I will have to put to creative use shortly….
