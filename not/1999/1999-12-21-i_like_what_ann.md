I like what [Annie](http://annie.newdream.net/) writes. I know that self-oriented writing by an undergrad is supposed to be unbearably **precious and inane**, but sheâ€™s very talented, and funny too.

Of course, it helps that the first writing of hers I read was [this](http://annie.newdream.net/winter/whatpeoplesay.html), part of an excellent larger piece found [here](http://annie.newdream.net/winter/).
