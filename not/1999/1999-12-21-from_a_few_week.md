From a few weeks ago on [mrbarrett.com](http://www.mrbarrett.com) there was a link to [this amazing piece](http://www.atomicarchive.com/Example/Example1.shtml), which I would consider a **must-read** for anyone who lives in the New York area.

**Speaking of which**, [Bird on a Wire](http://students.washington.edu/lwinn/bird/map/)â€˜s blog map will let you find other NYC weblogs, although I seem to have a strange propensity for Minneapolitan blogs.
