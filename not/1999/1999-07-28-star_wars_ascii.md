Okay, sorry about all that silliness yesterday, we now return to **serious, useful, and relevant** content. Exhibit A: [This incredible work of art](http://www.asciimation.co.nz), courtesy of a young man in New Zealand who apparently has waaay too much free time on his hands.

To give you an idea of how **time-consuming** this is, he’s only up to the tractor-beam scene, and he’s been working **since 1997**. Ugh.
