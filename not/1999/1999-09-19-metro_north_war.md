So for every "rule" of web design, there are of course **necessary exceptions**. I hate animated GIFs for the most part. I hate pointless uses of bright, distracting color. But I’ll be damned if I don’t like this little picture that the [Metro-North Railroad](http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/mnr/) used to alert passengers to the schedules as modified by [Hurricane Floyd](http://www.weather.com/breaking_weather/encyclopedia/tropical/names.html) last week.

(Link above is double-duty. Refers to hurricane, and **answers everyone’s questions** to me last week about where the naming system comes from. Why did everyone ask me? And why did I know the answer?)

But why the hell doesn’t the last row of pixels in "Click Here" blink? Curse me and my obsessiveness…

**Unrelated question**: Lloyd, two L’s. Floyd, one L. There’s something damned annoying about all of this. And why aren’t both L’s capitalized?
