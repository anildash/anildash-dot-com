An interestingly eventful day yesterday, as winter used to bring 6 inches of snow to the area, but we woke to **6 inches of mud**.

Sadly, I was too occupied with moving our car to higher ground and was unable to get any photos of the surreal event. I will post links as soon as I find any photos online dealing with the flood, because it was **among the more amazing things** Iâ€™ve seen in Manhattan. [Details](http://www.nytimes.com/99/12/30/news/national/regional/ny-water-break.html) are online, though, along with one [photo](http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/news/national/regional/ny-water-break.1.jpg.html), which actually *understates* the havoc wreaked. (Annoying registration required.)
