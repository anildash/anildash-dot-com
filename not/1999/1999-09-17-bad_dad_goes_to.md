Went to the grocery store the other day. (Did I mention **I love grocery stores**?) The fellow in front of me in the express aisle had three items:

A 6-pack of 12-ounce Bud Light Longnecks. Bag of pork rinds frozen White Castle burgers. And a 4-pack of baby bottles. **What a dad.**

(Above was amended upon correction of my memory by my oh-so-helpful partner in crimeâ€¦)
