In honor of my **impending move back to New York**, here’s something very cool. Called the [CyberTimes Navigator](http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/reference/cynavi.html), it is the page NY Times reporters use internally as their **start page for doing research**. (BTW, this might require that annoying NY Times registration– I hope not, but maybe. Sorry.)

**Very cool stuff!** Notice [APB Online](http://www.apbonline.com) is one of their newly-added sources. Way to go, Hans….
