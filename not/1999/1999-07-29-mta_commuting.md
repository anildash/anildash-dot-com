Today and yesterday I have used the [Metropolitan Transit Authority](http://mta.nyc.ny.us)‘s trains to go to work. I have been a big believer in **public transportation**, as long as I personally didn’t have to use it.

However, the experience has been fun and suprisingly restful. Although I **still can’t imagine** how people do this for years on end, it’s nice going from theory to practice.

And perhaps it’s just that we pay attention to the **most proximal danger**, but I can’t stop thinking about [Colin Ferguson](http://www.law.cornell.edu/unabom/lirr.html). I imagine for the people who do this as a way of life, that must have been a violation on the same order as a home invasion.
