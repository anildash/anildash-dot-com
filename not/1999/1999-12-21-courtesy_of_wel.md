> I love the ritual of peeling an orange. the smell, the stickiness, the taste. and I just discovered that the inner skin of orange pieces is really nice to touch. it feels a lot like people skin. like the inside of your arm, near your elbow.

You are *so* right! I am big on oranges, too, (see also Recurrent Obsessions) and I’m **glad I’m not the only one** to savor this subtle, transcendent, sublime pleasure.

Or maybe there’s just two of us freaks.
