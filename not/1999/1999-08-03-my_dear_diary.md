**Phew!** That was a long entry yesterday… but enough with the term paper on bioengineering. Let’s see if we can find a fun, interesting site, shall we? Or how about merely **creepy**, as in this voyeuristic oddity, [My Dear Diary](http://www.mydeardiary.com), which shows once again that people will go to any length to draw attention to themselves.

As if the Jerry Springer Show’s existence weren’t proof enough of the concept, witness **actual people** writing their **actual diaries** on the world wide web. What possesses people to generate content for commercial companies without any desire for remuneration? Next thing you know, people will **voluntarily wear advertising** on their shirts, or baseball caps. Or maybe even get a company’s logo tattooed on them.

Anyway, for a particularly horrendous display of bad poetry, courtesy of **My Dear Diary**, please see [this entry](http://www.mydeardiary.com/cgi-bin/diary.cgi?page=16&amp;author=The_Vixen) by a woman who has chosen the nom de keyboarde of **The Vixen**. Ahem.
