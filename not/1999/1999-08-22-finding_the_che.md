Looks like the **apartment hunt** is finally bearing some fruit… not just one, but *two* good candidates today, with the second one being the oh-so-wired [Chesapeake Building](http://www.chesapeakenyc.com) which is only two blocks from my old place on 92nd.

The big news on this new place? **A T-1 line!** Now, *that’s* living!
