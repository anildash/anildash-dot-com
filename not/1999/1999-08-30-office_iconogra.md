Little bit of appreciation for **good design**— despite an underwhelming set of new features, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com)‘s [Office 2000](http://www.microsoft.com/office) has got some damn cool icons.

They’re almost childlike in their simplicity, they’re extremely distinct from one another, even at very low resolutions, and they only use a few colors. Obviously, the whole design is very **web-savvy**. Interesting that one of the industry pundits said (derisively) that they looked as if they had been drawn with a crayon… I took that **as a compliment** to the designers.

Here’s a sampling:

My **favorite** of all of these is **Outlook**. Besides being a kind of neat program with a horrible interface, the small icon for the program evokes not just the "clock" element of the product’s time-management features, but also consists of an **O** and an **L**. OL = **O**ut**l**ook. Cool!
