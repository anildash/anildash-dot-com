Shouldn’t the **progress bars be resizable** in modern operating systems?

I was at a client and wanted to see how far along a certain task was, but I was across the room and **couldn’t resize the damn thing** to be visible down the hall. They added *drop shadows* to the cursor in Windows 2000 and can’t make it easier to see how far along the loading of a web page has progressed?

And Windows is *much* more accessible than MacOS, or especially Linux. I like BeOS in concept, how is its accessibilty? **[Let me know!](mailto:anil@dashes.com)**
