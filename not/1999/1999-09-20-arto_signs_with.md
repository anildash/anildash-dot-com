Dammit, I just can’t stop **starting trends**. I half-jokingly put up my "FadMaker" section on the sidebar when [Ani signs Arto Lindsay](http://www.anidifranco.net/new/newbandsonrbr.html) to her label. As part of my ongoing "Circular Reference ’99" tour, flip through my CD collection to reveal Arto’s "*Mundo Civilizado*", which features, what else, a cover of [Prince](http://www.love4oneanother.com)‘s "Erotic City".

First, she plays with [Maceo](http://www.maceo.com), then with Prince, and now she’s got [Arto](http://www.rykodisc.com/rykointernal/limited/lindsay/). Ummm, Ani– would you like me to fax you a request list?
