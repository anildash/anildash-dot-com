[Violet](http://www.violet.com/search.asp) is a neat little ecom site that I’m surprised hasn’t done a bigger push this holiday season. I particularly liked their gift suggester, called "Inspiration" :

> We’ve got it three different ways: logical, emotional and personal. Choose one of the searches below for inspiring suggestions that’ll help you pinpoint the perfect gift.

Interestingly, I’m plugging Violet not just because it’s a cool site with relatively cool products, but **because of the sites they put their banner ads on**. Is it overly arbitrary for me to give them credit for that?
