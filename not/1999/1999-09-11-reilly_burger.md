**Prepare to be impressed.** There exists among us a man like no other. Sure, we are all exceptional in some way. But truly few are as blessed with a gift as [this Boston University senior](http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/249/living/A_BU_senior_s_feeds_of_daring-.shtml). I have two words for you: **20,000 Calories**. It really does give a man hope to see something like this.

We’re drafting an email to send him (we found his email address) and I’m hoping his response will be compelling enough to print here… more to come!
