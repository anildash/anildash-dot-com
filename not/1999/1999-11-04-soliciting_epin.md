On an unrelated note, I’m going to begin **soliciting epinions** on different items, not so that I have topics to write about, but so that other people can get paid for me reading their reviews. You see, the many unanticipated needs that pop up when setting up a new household seem to me the perfect opportunity to get recommendations from the epinions community.

Or, to put it more succinctly, [send me links to your reviews](mailto:anil@dashes.com) of products that might be useful to a newborn home, and I’ll be glad to link them and review them, both here and from [my Epinons page](http://www.epinions.com/user-anildash).
