Today's most fun new [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) app is Record Player, which lets you upload a photo, then uses Google Cloud's Vision API to recognize the image and play it on Spotify.

And you can, of course, [View Source](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/record-player?path=README.md:1:0) for the app and remix it to make your own variations.
