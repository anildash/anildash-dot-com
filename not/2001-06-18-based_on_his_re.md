Based on his [Release 1.0](http://release1.edventure.com/index.cfm) article, Kevin Werbach [says](http://www.edventure.com/conversation/article.cfm?Counter=7444662), "[T]he boundaries between committed amateurs and working journalists may be difficult to determine"

[Walt Mossberg](http://ptech.wsj.com/walt.html) made the same point to me recently, among other points, in his [recent email](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_06_01_archive.php#3982162). I’m glad that the boundaries to the field are being broadened and democratized a bit. But, as my own foibles attest, there’s a potential downside to it. I suppose those [trust](http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~adam/local/trust.html)[mechanisms](http://www.zdnet.com/devhead/stories/articles/0,4413,387393,00.html) we’ve been [prattling](http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue3_6/khare/) about [ad nauseum](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990307.html) would come in handy here. And I’d get a C- or something for my rating.
