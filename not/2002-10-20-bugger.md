Sometimes following the links into one’s site reveals precious little gems of the web. But then again, sometimes you just get [NETQUEER](http://www.netqueer.com/). Apparently, when they ripped off [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)‘s design, they attributed a quote to "Bob Stephens" without changing the hyperlink to my page that was in the original, stolen HTML.

But that’s no big deal. I’m no zealot when it comes to stolen site designs. I just wish they hadn’t avoided the obvious opportunities that this sort of branding offers. Why NETQUEER? Why not BUGGER? "Push-button punishing for the asses"! I’d sign up for that.

And talk about a lack of ambition: What kind of a goal is this? "Netqueer’s purpose is and has always been to unite gay and bi men." That’s like striving to unite fat kids and cookies. I think they should just try harder all around.
