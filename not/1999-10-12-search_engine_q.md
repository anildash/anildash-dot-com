**Warning:** Repeated viewing of these links may lead to either hysterical laughing, or deep depression once you realize just how sad the results are… either way, please see [MetaSpy](http://www.metaspy.com/) and [WebCrawler Voyeur](http://www.webcrawler.com/voyeur_wc).

Both are pretty neat, showing the results of other people’s searches of the web, (I’m betting a similar service for [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com) could actually get people to pay to see it. Maybe as a continuous XML data stream…) but it’s terrifying to think that people who have the **entire wealth of human knowledge** at their fingertips spend this much time trying to find naked pictures of Britney Spears.
