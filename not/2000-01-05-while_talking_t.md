While talking to [Damien](http://www.mrbarrett.com) I remarked that the only way [Apple](http://www.apple.com) could jeopardize its recent revitalization would be to compromise the usability and elegant design that has been the hallmark of the Mac since its introduction.

Well, it would appear that [today’s news](http://macosrumors.com/?powerexpress=mwsf2K) makes it clear that Apple **hasn’t learned the lesson**. Look at [the interface for Apple’s next-generation OS](http://www.apple.com/macosx/desktop.html).

The took the **ugly, unusable feel of QuickTime 4** and slopped it all over the OS. Now granted, they added semi-transparent menus and fading options like Windows 2000, which I *do* like the look of. But what a mess… it’s a shame, really.

And let’s try to guess what the hell that picture above is supposed to be… Stop, Slow, Go? Nope, it’s Close, Minimize, and Maximize. **Dumb, Dumb, and Dumb**. See also the complaints I had on September 20, where I linked to [Isys Information Systems](http://www.iarchitect.com/qtime.htm).
