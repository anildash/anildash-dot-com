I usually don’t talk very much about computer hardware, mostly due to a lack of interest in the stuff. There’s just nothing cool going on, for the most part. But I am still a geek, so it’s still easy to get my attention with something as cool as the (horribly named) [Sony PCG-GT3/K](http://www.dynamism.com/gt3/main.shtml).
