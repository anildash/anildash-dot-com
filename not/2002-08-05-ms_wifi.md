I am wondering why Microsoftâ€™s announcement of [upcoming WiFi products](http://microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-11wirelessqa.asp) has flown under the radar so much. I can understand that their BlueTooth mouse and keyboard are being downplayed until BlueTooth support is better in XP, but this is a peculiar omission.
