[Mike](http://www.perpetualbeta.com/2001_01_21_archive.html#2092377)‘s got an analysis of my [goofy tax idea](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_01_01_archive.php#2045581) that includes the following endorsement: **"This might actually be the most regressive tax ever proposed by anyone, anywhere."**

Yeah, I *knew* there was some reason not to do it…
