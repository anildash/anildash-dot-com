I would like to read the story about various Mac websites or periodicals dissing the Pentium in the past and then greeting today’s announcement with excitement and glee. I don’t have the time to look up those old articles myself, but it’s a good way to get both the Mac-haters and the Mac-supporters angry at you and reading the piece.

Tell your assignment editor that I’m guaranteeing at least a number 10 spot on Blogdex, and a lengthy long tail shelf life as people continually refer back to the story in future blog posts, either to demonstrate the fickleness of the Mac audience or its open-minded willingness to change and evolve.
