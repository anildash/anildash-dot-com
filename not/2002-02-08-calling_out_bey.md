Speaking of belated messages, here’s one I’ve been meaning to relay…

**Confidential to Beyonce K. in Houston:** Diana Ross’s career is rolling over in its grave because your publicists won’t stop mentioning the Supremes and your group in the same sentence. And I have three letters for you: SWV. I got some jelly you ain’t ready for, baby. Puttin’ the “boot” in “booty”, know what I’m sayin?
