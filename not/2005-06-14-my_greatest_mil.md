I’ve been very fortunate thus far in my career, getting to work on really interesting projects with very smart people, getting to meet some of my heroes, having the satisfaction of seeing my work acknowledged by users or my peers. But perhaps no recognition that I’ve received is quite so flattering as the fact that there’s been a [vote for deletion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Anil_Dash) (VfD) for the Wikipedia page about me. There’s certainly good reasons for haters to be annoyed by me, but you’re nobody until somebody hates you for no good reason at all.

Thanks to [Justin](http://www.links.net) for the heads-up. And if you’re looking for a productive, non-goofy contribution to Wikipedia, Dan’s doing [some amazing work](http://stilicho.blogspot.com/2005/06/lynching-of-anthony-crawford.html), as always.
