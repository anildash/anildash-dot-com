And, while I’m enjoying some good music, you can do the same… the *best* music, in fact. [*Corcovado*](http://www.sp.utexas.edu/ork/solelua/corcolet.htm), by Antonio Carlos Jobim. [Jobim](http://www.jobim.com.br/e.index.html)‘s one of my favorite composers, and this is one of my favorite of his works.

> Quiet nights of quiet stars
> 
> Quiet chords from my guitar
> 
> Floating on the silence that surrounds us
> 
> Quiet walks by quiet streams
> 
> Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams
> 
> And a window that looks out on Corcovado
> 
> Oh, how lovely
> 
> This is where I want to be
> 
> Here with you so close to me
> 
> Until the final flicker of life’s amber
> 
> I who was lost and lonely
> 
> Believing life was only
> 
> A bitter tragic joke
> 
> Have found with you
> 
> The meaning of existence, oh my love
