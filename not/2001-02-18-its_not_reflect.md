It’s not reflected on [their website](http://www.aarp.com/mmaturity/) yet, but the print version of the AARP’s magazine "Modern Maturity" got a slick redesign… the cover blurbs are still in large fonts, but the whole look bespeaks of their new sub-65 demographic.

I’ve got more to say on this, as soon as I think it all through, but there are two points about the AARP in general, and Modern Maturity in particular that stick in my mind. First is that the articles are well-written and of interest to me even at 25 years old. But the second is that the ceaseless and shameless advocacy seems so presumptive that their audience is all of one mind about the issues facing them, which seems ridiculous given the millions of members they count and the millions more that they claim to represent.
