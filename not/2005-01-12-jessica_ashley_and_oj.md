I don’t know how the Boston Globe publishes this, since it ain’t hardly news, but "[Ashlee Simpson’s career comes courtesy of Daddy dearest](http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2005/01/11/ashlee_simpsons_career_comes_courtesy_of_daddy_dearest/)".

Dear Joe Simpson: I know, since you’re a pathological bastard with likely infanticidal tendencies that you’re unlikely to listen to my advice, but please, *stop*. Stop your crazy ass. Stop it now.

Or don’t come crying to me when Ashlee is feeding [jesus juice](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/010605jackson.html) to people on her giant theme park ranch. This shit doesn’t turn out well, friend. Not well at all.
