[Geek Poetry](http://torrez.org/archives/000103.html#000103)? Inspired by absence and distance? Hmm…

I’m but a server, awaiting request,

Proffering pages at your behest.

Since your state persists,

It seems your hist’ry list,

Does to your reciprocation attest.

You should be glad I took out the part about the “user agent”.
