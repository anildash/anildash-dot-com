I’ve had friends ask why I have advertising on my site; After all, it’s not like I’m gonna pay the rent with the kind of traffic that a Snoop Dogg fansite drives. Usually, I explain that I just like to understand how that stuff works, to keep up to date with the customers I deal with at [work](http://www.sixapart.com/), or just because of curiosity.

But today, I have a much better answer. It’s because sometimes that little bit of Google code can make something *magical* happen.
