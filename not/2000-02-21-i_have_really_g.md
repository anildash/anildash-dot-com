**I have really good luck.**

On Friday morning, I dropped my wallet as I got out of a cab. I realized it almost immediately, but by the time I got back to that intersection, it was, of course, gone.

Naturally, this ruined my whole day and I was totally bummed out. Little did I know that a good samaritan had already found my wallet, used my [MetroCard](http://metrocard.citysearch.com) to take the subway up to my building, and returned it to our doorman.

With all the contents *intact*. **Woo hoo**! I donâ€™t care what anyone says, New Yorkers are the nicest people in the world.
