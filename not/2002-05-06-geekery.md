Geeks are at their happiest when among those who understand them. One of the pleasant things about my job is being surrounded, to a certain degree, by geeks of all sorts. (Web geeks, writing geeks, news geeks…) Witness this excerpt of an email from a co-worker:

> I’m currently in [regex](http://www.evolt.org/article/Regular_Expression_Basics/20/22700/index.html) hell. I was just telling [my wife] that “search and replace” in a program like Word is one of those things we completely take for granted but is amazingly complex, like running water.

And the sad part, of course, is that I agree with him. I’m biased though, I used to help run a water company.
