To all who emailed, thanks for the kind words and commisseration in regards to "[Pardon Me…](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_08_01_archive.php#5238868)" In reply to the most asked question, you can **feel free to use my rant as a reply** to whomever you want, all I ask is that you credit me (just put “from anildash.com” at the bottom or something) and that you make it clear to the person you’re replying to that *you* are sending my words to them. I don’t need hate mail from your friends, I get enough from my own.
