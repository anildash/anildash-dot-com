I’ve been doing a good bit of speaking lately, and have some more coming up, so let me share it with you if you’re interested.

- I was flattered to have my [post about Gawker](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/10/gawker-reckoning.html) quoted in passing by [Jim Romenesko](http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&amp;aid=131570) while talking about Vanessa Grigoriadis. However, I was mortified at the context — Page Six of the NY Post had published a thinly-veiled threat of sexual violence against Ms. Grigoriadis. **Let’s repeat:** The traditional, mainstream, dead-tree media institution published a threat of sexual violence on newsprint. And those who objected? The folks typing away in Movable Type at [Radar Online](http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2007/10/cross-page-and-get-raped.php) and [Media Bistro](http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/newspapers/noted_in_page_six_69098.asp). *This* is why we need blogs to help fix traditional media.
- I got to spend an hour talking to John C. Havens over at [Blog Talk Radio](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/transparency/2007/10/16/Interview-with-Anil-Dash) which was ostensibly about transparency, but ended up getting into a good bit of blog history and some more philosophical parts of blogging. That was a lot of fun, and I was glad to get to do it.
- On Friday, I’ll be speaking at the [Online News Association Conference](http://www.journalists.org/2007conference/) in Toronto. I’ll only be in town for a few hours, unfortunately, even though I love Toronto, but the discussion about [Journalism Next](http://journalists.org/2007conference/archives/000770.php) is right up my alley. And I’m especially looking forward to getting to meet the other folks on the panel.
- And then on Saturday, I’ll be at [ConvergeSouth 2007](http://www.convergesouth.com/) in Greensboro, North Carolina. It looks to be an absolutely amazing event, and I’ll be joining in at [10am on Saturday](http://www.convergesouth.com/schedule/saturday.php) for my panel. I’ll also be hosting a dinner at 6:30 on Saturday, you can [sign up on the wiki](http://2007.convergesouth.com/wiki/index.php/HomePage) to join the table.

Phew! Can’t wait to meet a bunch of new folks, and if you want to get in touch and will be at either event, my mobile number and email address are both right here on my blog.
