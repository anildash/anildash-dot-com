Though I’ve been familiar with the terms for years, I wasn’t sure of the exact differences between a pidgin and a creole. So:

- A [creole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language) is the combination of one or more languages into a new, stable language. A mashup of languages, if you will.
- A [pidgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin) is a simplified language used to help two groups with distinct languages communicate with each other.

“Creole”, of course, is also a term used to refer to various [ethnic and social groups](http://www.cajunculture.com/Other/creole.htm). Now I feel better that I know the difference between these terms.
