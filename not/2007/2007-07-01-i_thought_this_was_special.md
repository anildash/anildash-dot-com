Back in 2001, I got laid off from a job right around the same time as Sam Brown, the creator of [Exploding Dog](http://www.explodingdog.com/). Over the course of that year, as I looked for work and worked to remake a lot of my life, Sam spent much of his time creating illustrations based on captions submitted from his audience. I took a lot of inspiration from the work that Sam did on the site.
[![This Is Special](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/thisisspecial-sm.png)](http://www.explodingdog.com/shirtorder/items/explodingdog2001/)

We met for the first time later that year at a meet-up for his fans (He insists that I was proclaiming adamantly at the time that I wasn’t into blogging) and have run into each other a number of times along the way, especially at Mark Hurst’s [Gel Conference](http://www.gelconference.com/). In some ways, as the popularity of his site has grown, I’ve felt a bit like someone watching a favorite local band start to become a well-known name. Except without the feeling that the artist has sold out.

Back then, I used to check in on the Exploding Dog every few days; It was a nice, simple respite during a time when I didn’t have a lot of them. So I was thrilled to hear that [Exploding Dog 2001](http://www.explodingdog.com/shirtorder/items/explodingdog2001/) has been published, a single book collecting all of the pictures from that year. The [illustrations from 2001](http://www.explodingdog.com/2001.html) were fun and affecting as I’d remembered, and though Sam’s sent me a copy since I started working on this post, I’d have gotten a copy of the book regardless. You should too.

The title of this post is from [the image shown above](http://www.explodingdog.com/feb26/thisisspecial.html). If you’re looking for more, be sure to check out the first chapter of [Beware of the Seamonsters](http://explodingdog.com/seamonsters/), a brand-new animation from Exploding Dog.
