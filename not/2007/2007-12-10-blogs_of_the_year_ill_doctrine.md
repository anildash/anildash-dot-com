**Today’s Blog of the Year Pick:**[Ill Doctrine](http://www.illdoctrine.com).

Put simply, Jay Smooth’s Ill Doctrine is the best video blog on the web. (At least the best one that’s in English.) As you’d expect from the founder of [hiphopmusic.com](hiphopmusic.com), Ill Doc starts from a base of reporting on hip hop music and culture. But from that starting point, Jay branches into ruminations on celebrity, culture, politics, and art with real feeling. I don’t think anybody else could make me both roll my eyes at *and* empathize with Amy Winehouse in the space of just a few minutes, let alone [turn “Chocolate Rain” into a non-ironic jam](http://www.illdoctrine.com/2007/08/chocolate_radiohead.html). And for casual viewers, nobody does a better job of breaking down complex topics like the [bust of DJ Drama](http://www.illdoctrine.com/2007/06/dj_drama_and_the_riaa.html) by the RIAA than Ill Doctrine.

The editing’s tight, the videos frequently feature original music and interviews, and there’s a bracing honesty to much of the conversation that really connected for me.
**Pick of the Posts:**

- [Amy Winehouse and the Ethics of Clowning People](http://www.illdoctrine.com/2007/11/amy_winehouse_and_the_ethics_o.html)
- [Machine Guns and Stupid Choices](http://www.illdoctrine.com/2007/10/machine_guns_and_stupid_choice.html)
- [Black Coach](http://www.illdoctrine.com/2007/06/black_coach.html)
- And [Introducing the Ill Doctrine](http://www.illdoctrine.com/2007/06/introducing_the_ill_doctrine.html), the best place to start.
**If you like this, try:** Catching up on [Ze Frank](http://www.zefrank.com/)‘s [archives for The Show](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow). I wasn’t kidding when I said he was [our I Love Lucy](http://www.movabletype.com/blog/2007/03/ze-frank-our-i-love-lucy.html).
