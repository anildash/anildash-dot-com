This week I figured I’d try something a little bit different. I’m not usually one for product reviews, except for talking about different websites from time to time. But lately, I’ve been fortunate enough to find a bunch of *really good experiences* with various products and services I’ve used, so I figured I’d use my blog to talk about them.

(Note to marketers and PR people: See — bloggers really *do* talk about things positively, not just when they’re complaining! Also, don’t send me your pitches — every single one of these products and services is something I found on my own. And if you send me an unsolicited pitch about your product, I guarantee I *won’t* mention it.)

For each of these products or services, I’ll be offering up a brief description, an account of my experience, a list of gotchas to look out for, what it costs, and then some guidelines of how to judge if you’ll like it. These fall under the headings of **What It Is**, **The Experience**, **The Gotchas**, **What It Costs** and **Recommended If You Like**.

I’ll be reviewing these products:

- [Clear Card](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-clear-card.html)
- [Mozy](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-mozy.html)
- [Virgin America](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-virgin-america.html)
- [LimoLiner](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/12/unsolicited-testimonial-limoliner.html)
- ZipCar

Feel free to send me a link if you’ve written up anything about them that I should link to.
