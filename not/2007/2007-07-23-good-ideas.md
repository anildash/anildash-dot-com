The International Design Excellence Awards (IDEA) winners for 2007 have [been posted](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_31/b4044401.htm) on BusinessWeek’s site. There are all of the usual slideshows and essays that you’d expect, but perhaps the coolest tool is the [interactive table of winners](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_31/b4044401.htm) from 2000 to 2007, sortable by client, school, or designer.
