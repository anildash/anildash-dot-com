The folks at Cranky Geeks have just put up [a new episode of the show](http://www.crankygeeks.com/2007/01/cranky_geeks_bonus_episode_46_1.html), though it was actually taped a while ago and was the first episode I ever participated in. We taped the episode before Google bought YouTube, and the bright-eyed speculation about YouTube’s future during that simpler time looks downright quaint today.

Things were a little rough around the edges (it’s slow going for most of the show), but you *do* get to hear me say, “I like the crappy videos”. And you get to hear how J.D. Lasica picks out his favorite porn sites.
