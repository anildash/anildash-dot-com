This weekend, I’m making my first trip to Vancouver (and my first trip to Canada in over 3 years) to speak at the [Northern Voice 2007](http://2007.northernvoice.ca/) blogging conference. I’m really excited to get to meet a lot of new people, as well as finally getting to meet a number of long-time bloggers in person.

If you’ll be in Vancouver, drop me a line (email is [anil@dashes.com](mailto:anil@dashes.com) and my mobile phone is 646-541-5843) and I hope we can meet up. I’m not sure exactly how much free time I’ll have, but I’m hoping to try at least one good local restaurant, as well, since I’ll be staying downtown.

Oh, and [I’m looking for restaurant suggestions](http://www.seriouseats.com/talk/2007/02/what-are-the-best-restaurant-p.html) as well — if you’re local, hook me up.
