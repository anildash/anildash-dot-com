There’s no better link-bait than science fiction where you’re one of the characters. See Kevin Fanning’s “[How Everything Turned Out](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/stories/how_everything_turned_out.php)” in The Morning News.

Old-school readers will warmly remember Kevin’s cover of the Bee Gee’s “How Deep Is Your Love”, now sadly offline.
