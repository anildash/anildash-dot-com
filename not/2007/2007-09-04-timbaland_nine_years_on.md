Speaking of Timberlake, that brings us inevitably to Timbaland. After the [fawning over Rick Rubin](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?ex=1346385600&amp;en=13e3933c3b59c9dd&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink) in the New York Times, it’s amazing that there hasn’t been a similarly high-profile profile of the best producer working in pop music today.

Until then, this [piece from The Wire](http://www.thewire.co.uk/archive/interviews/timbaland.html) should do nicely, even though it’s nine (!) years old. The article comes courtesy of [Sasha-Frere Jones](http://www.sashafrerejones.com/2007/08/archival.html), both for blogging its reappearance online and for writing it in the first place.
