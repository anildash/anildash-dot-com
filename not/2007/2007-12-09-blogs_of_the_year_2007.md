This week, I’ll be highlighting the sites that I think stood out this year. July marked the 8th anniversary of my blog, and over these past eight and a half years, my appreciation of what it takes to run a successful blog has really grown and changed. As a result, many of these picks are admittedly subjective, and are based on the fact that I think the best blogging is an art, a skill, and a craft like any other form of creative expression.

That’s not to say blogging can’t also be a business, or just an outlet for venting, or all of the above — some of the best sites alternate through these different modes of communication. But **these are the ones that moved me** or inspired me or just entertained me this year. Each is accompanied by a brief description, a screenshot, some sample posts, and some suggestions of related or similar or complementary blogs you should check out.

As always, your recommendations of other sites, especially more obscure ones, are very welcome. Astoundingly, it’s been *five years* since [the last time I recommended some blogs](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/09/some-commendati.html). I think there may be a few more blogs around now. (Last time I did say that Gizmodo was a promising newcomer, so lookit me, I’m a geeenius!)
**The Picks:**
