From Mike’s Cruftbox, [Bud Light + Clamato = Chelada](http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001429.html), a recent and spectacularly gross bit of research from Cruft Labs. Meanwhile, Skot’s Izzle Pfaff offers [Preparade](http://www.izzlepfaff.com/blog/archives/2007/07/preparade.php), a reminiscence of a class reunion which features, you guessed it, beers cut with Clamato. “Fish ran out of Clamato, and there was a minor flurry of dismay among

some of the women, but it then subsided after they glumly ordered some

more beer.”

I try not to judge, but that’s just gross, people. Gross.
