Wait, remember when I said that [Zolt Levay has the coolest job in the world](/2006/12/18/zolt_levay_the_), making images from Hubble data? Scratch that, now [Mike Massee at XCOR Aerospace](http://www.xcor.com/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=1302) has the coolest job in the world: Taking awesome photos of methane rocket engines!

Best of all, you can even get [silver halide prints](http://www.mojaveairandspace.com/products/XCORsilverprints.html) of the sci-fi looking test firing. That’s courtesy of Mojave Air & Space Collectibles, an interesting little company that’s popped up to fill the niche of people looking for memorabilia from the many new private space programs that are starting to take off.
