South Asians with blood disorders only have a 1 in 20,000 chance of finding compatible marrow donors, in part due to the fact that less than 1% of those registered in the National Marrow Donor Program are of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladesh, or Sri Lankan descent. I was alerted to this fact by [Help Vinay](http://www.helpvinay.org/dp/), a site created to help raise awareness and to find a donor for [Vinay Chakravarthy](http://www.helpvinay.org/dp/index.php?q=node/6), a 28-year-old Indian American doctor who has Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

I’ll be registering as a donor at the [registration drive](http://www.helpvinay.org/dp/index.php?q=node/104) at the South Asian Journalist’s Assocation conference where I’m speaking on Friday. If you’ll be there, you can register as well (it’s just a simple cheek swab). Because I have a significant number of Indian and South Asian readers, especially in the Bay Area, I’d urge you all to check out the [list of upcoming donor drives](http://www.helpvinay.org/dp/index.php?q=event) and participate yourself. And to find out more, check out [AsianMarrow.org](http://asianmarrow.org/), which offers a lot more information about the complexity of finding matches for Asians who need marrow transplants.
