A nice update on the idea of **improving tactile feedback** is this related concept from [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com), a [touch-sensitive mouse](http://www.research.microsoft.com/ui/touchmouse/). The prototype appears to be pretty far along, although they’ve done only small-scale subjective testing.

Not that there’s anything wrong with that. [Jakob](http://www.useit.com) would insist we only need 6 users anyway to test a concept.

It works by measuring natural skin capacitance against the **special conducting paint** that covers several surfaces on the mouse. Coolest trick: It makes the extraneous toolbars in WinWord **fade away** when the user’s hand isn’t on the mouse.

Somebody’s got their thinking cap on, eh? I’d set the damn thing to go straight into full-screen mode, myself, but it’s certainly a nice concept.
