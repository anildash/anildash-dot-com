It’s an all-Office day today. The Globe and Mail embraces the bad pun with “[Stressed? Busy? Excel-erate your life](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060826.EXCEL26/TPStory/)“. Tralee Pearce amusingly asserts that “The must-have fall accessory is your desktop spreadsheet program”:

> This fall’s coolest accessory is not a trophy handbag, a designer shoe or a pair of skinny jeans. It’s a computer program sitting right there on your desktop.
> 
> Sure, you use your Microsoft Excel to track business expenses and create spreadsheets by day. But legions of Excel-literates are databasing their lives, charting their wardrobes, dinner-party menus and DVD collections by night.

My only lament is that there’s no link to [the canonical post about people geeking out in Excel](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/04/22/excel_pile).
