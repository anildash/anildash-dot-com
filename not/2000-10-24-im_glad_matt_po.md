I’m glad Matt pointed out [Marshall Dyllon](http://www.hit-or-miss.org/post/712), as I was (this is the truth, I swear!) just asking yesterday why there are **no country boy-bands**, since it would seem to be such a natural fit.

Phew! Now that’s taken care of. Too bad I didn’t get a chance to throw that down there in the FadMaker before this was discovered.
