If you want to own a piece of history, you can buy [my old laptops](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=177&amp;item=5132071010&amp;rd=1) that I [reviewed on my blog](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/01/21/vpr_matrix_lapt) and featured in [a story in Business 2.0](https://curtain.timeinc.net/EC/challenge.jhtml;jsessionid=SP4MTANHFMZV4QAMG4EBQBQ?zone=EC&amp;_requestid=1486758)!

Okay, itâ€™s just my old laptop and its broken predecessor, but I figured it sounded more exciting to call it a piece of history.
