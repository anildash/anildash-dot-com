Wish I’d have seen this info before about [running ZoneAlarm with Windows 2000 SP1](http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/deleteframe.pl?story=/articles/op/xml/00/08/14/000814oplivingston.xml) before I tore my hair out figuring how my network connection died…

Oh, and you can check out the beta of what I’ve been working on at work, if you want to give me comments, at [htttp://www.supersoni.com/index.php](http://www.supersoni.com/index.php).

But *don’t* tell me it’s slow. I know it’s dog slow…
