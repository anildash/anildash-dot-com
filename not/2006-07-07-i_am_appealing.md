Microsoft’s AdCenter advertising service has a [demographic predictor](http://adlab.microsoft.com/DPUI/DPUI.aspx) as part of their labs; It’s supposed to indicate what audience can be expected to respond to a certain search term or URL. Here’s the results for dashes.com:
**Gender:** Male Oriented with following Confidence:

- Female: 0.46
**Age:**

I’m a bit skeptical that my readers are that young, but it’s interesting to see what the service says regardless. And thanks to [George](http://www.allaboutgeorge.com/2006/07/thirty-five_babylon.html) for the link.
