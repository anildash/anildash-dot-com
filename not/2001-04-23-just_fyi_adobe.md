Just FYI, Adobe released [Acrobat 5.0](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/) today, and the Reader seems to have graduated from being miserably horrible to just unpleasant to work with. Also, they made some bizarro [ClearType](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/default.htm) clone that actually seems to improve the legibility of the text. (More info on ClearTypeâ€™s [sub-pixel rendering](http://grc.com/cleartype.htm), courtesy of Steve Gibson.)
