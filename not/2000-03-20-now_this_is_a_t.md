Now *this* is a [truly bizarre and convoluted story](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35054,00.html). And don’t get me wrong, I’m as [anti-Scieno](http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~schlicke/doc/xenu/%21%21%21FactNet%21%21%21/Scientology/scinternet.htm) as the next guy, but shouldn’t the Germans be working a little *extra* hard to try not to seem like they’re being religiously intolerant?
