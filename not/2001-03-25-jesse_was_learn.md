Jesse was learnin’ those boys [some new tricks](http://www.fairvue.com/sxsw2001/image.asp?number=54) down in Austin, as illustrated in [Nikolai](http://www.fairvue.com)‘s great photos. There are a host of great shots, including [this one](http://www.fairvue.com/sxsw2001/image.asp?number=36) that I think makes white girls’ heads seem just plain cool-lookin’ and [this one](http://www.fairvue.com/sxsw2001/image.asp?number=61) which shows Paul and a lathe, but omits the extremely difficult-to-open glass coke bottles.

Then, of course, there’s [this photo of Brad](http://www.fairvue.com/sxsw2001/image.asp?number=79), but if you notice the time above the photo, it was 2:10am and heading for Last Call. So it’s not really his fault, being the end of the night and all…
