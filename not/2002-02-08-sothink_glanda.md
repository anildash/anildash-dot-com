Some day I’m going to grow up and be a computer programmer. And when that day comes, I’ll write a program. Then, after the program is nearly done, I will struggle to name it. But eventually a name will reveal itself to me. And that name? [Sothink Glanda](http://www.sothink.com/webtools/glanda/index.htm).

I think that was the name of one of the Rancor monster’s guards in Jabba’s Palace, actually. Conversation with [Andre](http://torrez.org) about Glanda’s theoretical FAQ list yields such geekery as “**Does Sothink Glanda support Ogg Vorbis?**“

One can only hope.
