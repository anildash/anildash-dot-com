Since I’ve, uh, [cornered the market](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/05/10/blog_songs) on blogging about blog songs, I’m contractually obligated to link to [Gawk At This](http://theassimilatednegro.blogspot.com/2005/10/gawk-at-this-gawker-audio.html), the Gawker rap track by The Assimilated Negro. ([Full lyrics available](http://theassimilatednegro.blogspot.com/1990/04/gawk-at-this-lyrics.html).)

Not the first blog rap song, but certainly a credible effort. I am not sure we want to encourage this trend.
