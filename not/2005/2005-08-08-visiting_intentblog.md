This is a little outside my area of expertise, but that’s why I thought it might be interesting: I’ve just posted over on [IntentBlog](http://www.intentblog.com/archives/2005/08/anils_first_pos.html), a relatively new blog started by Deepak Chopra and Shekhar Kapur. I don’t usually participate in communities that are more focused on things like spirituality rather than topics like business or technology, so I’m hoping it’ll be a good stretch to try to learn from an audience that’s a little bit difference.

I also usually don’t participate in a lot of “Indian” websites, though I’m flattered that I get asked, because I think that’s a part of my identity that’s important to me, but relatively private. I’ll be trying to participate in IntentBlog whenever possible so that I can try writing about some new topics and from a new perspective. And at the very least, I’ll be reading the blog to see what it has to offer.
