We were looking through some old stuff on Mena’s site today, and the good news is that [every indication](http://dollarshort.org/mash/) is that I’m going to be living in a shack in New York, but that my three kids will keep me happy while we tool around in a black porsche. Go [play MASH](http://dollarshort.org/mash/) for yourself.
