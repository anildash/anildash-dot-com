I don’t have any words that can offer anyone in the U.K. true consolation or any thoughts that can undo what’s happened today. But those of us who were in New York four years ago know a little bit about what you’ve been through, and we’re all thinking of you. Stay safe and take care of yourselves, and I promise it gets a little bit better with time.
