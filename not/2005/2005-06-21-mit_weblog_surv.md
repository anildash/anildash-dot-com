[![Take the MIT Weblog Survey](http://blogsurvey.media.mit.edu/images/survey-powerlaw.gif)](http://blogsurvey.media.mit.edu/request)[Cam Marlow](http://www.overstated.net)‘s at it again, not content just to give us [Blogdex](http://www.blogdex.net) for free for years, but working on the [MIT Weblog Survey](http://blogsurvey.media.mit.edu/) to collect data about that blogosphere that he’ll weed through and share with all of us.

If you’ve got a blog, go fill out the survey yourself, and then use the (very witty!) link graphics on your site to get others to promote and complete the survey, too. It’ll help Cam become Dr. Cam, and it’ll feed bloggers’ insatiable lust for more information and conversation about themselves.
