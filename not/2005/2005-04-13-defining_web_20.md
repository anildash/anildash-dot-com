Because I’ve been following [Richard MacManus’ work](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/002690.php) on defining “Web 2.0” in Wikipedia, I really enjoyed [Dan’s rant](http://stilicho.blogspot.com/2005/04/blank-corporate-verse.html) about the terrible definition that was originally posted. I can’t think of anybody better qualified to sift through the bullshit.
