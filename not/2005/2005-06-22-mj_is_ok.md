Considering how many people have sent me the link, I’d be remiss if I didn’t pass along [MJ is OK!](http://www.mjisok.com/). $25 seems a little steep for a t-shirt, but the designs sure are attractive. I’d prefer that the glove part of the shirt be covered in rhinestones, but I guess that’s a lot to ask.
