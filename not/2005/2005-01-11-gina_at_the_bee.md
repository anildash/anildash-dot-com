Hey, cool, [Gina](http://www.scribbling.net)‘s post about fixing her mother-in-law’s computer made the [BBC website](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4156333.stm). I was spending those same few days doing some very similar tasks, so I’m glad to see that the unpaid IT department that actually subsidizes the tech industry is getting some press. I haven’t finished my post about the new a-list and the real alpha bloggers, but Gina is definitely among them. And I’m glad to see it.
