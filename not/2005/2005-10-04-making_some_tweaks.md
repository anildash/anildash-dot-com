If you’re reading my blog in a feed reader, c’mon over to [the HTML version](http://www.dashes.com/anil/) and take a look — it’s painfully bright! Thanks to [Lilia](http://www.lilia.com/) for making a beautiful template which I promptly uglified, and thanks to everybody who built the [Styles Library](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/styles/library) and StyleCatcher for Movable Type so I could easily swap in this theme.

(Don’t fret if it really does hurt your eyes; I can change the design with a few clicks. I just wanted to play with this for now.) And yeah, if you didn’t know, this [XHTML structure](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2005/08/smart_new_templ.html) works on LiveJournal, TypePad, and Movable Type, so I could theoretically ask millions of people to use bright purple on their sites and it’d be technically possible. Ain’t technology grand?
