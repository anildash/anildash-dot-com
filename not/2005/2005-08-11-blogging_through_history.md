Yeah, I love blogs and all that stuff. But the real reason I love working at Six Apart is that sometimes we get to do stuff that’s actually funny. [If Bloggers Had Been Around Throughout History](http://mena.typepad.com/photos/viewmaster/1.html) is the slideshow that Mena made for display in the [ViewMasters she gave away](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/08/a_different_typ.html) at the D conference a while back.

Getting to reach new audiences is great, but I really just like that Mena gave Bill Gates a ViewMaster that contains a thinly-veiled dick joke about an American president. We should make more so we can sell ’em in the company store. “New! Potentially offensive children’s toys!”
