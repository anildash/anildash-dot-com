The great thing about identity is that we get to make it up as we go along. Thus, [You My Midga](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050501/COMMENTARY/50429001), which ends with the inarguable conclusion “I prefer the Cockney versions of everything.” Thanks to [RCB](http://www.rebeccablood.net/) for the link, and big ups to Roger Ebert’s webmaster for the inexplicable “XHTML” in his page title. I bet his car says “STEEL” in big letters on the bumper.
