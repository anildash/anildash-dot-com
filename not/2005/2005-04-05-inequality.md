Maciej is (1) a friend (2) very funny and (3) in agreement with my beliefs, so I couldn’t resist linking to [Dabblers and Blowhards](http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm), his new essay.

But the key issue that appealed to me about his piece is that the fundamental problem with many people who *really* get our goat on the Internet is that they do it by talking about things that we care about, that we know a lot about or that we are knowledgeable about, without sharing any of these traits.

It may be helpful to create a table of equivalence, in the same way that a chef might substitute honey for sugar in a recipe if they’ve run out. Only, in this case, it’s bits of knowledge which *can’t* be substituted for one another. (These are all transitive.)

- Being a geek growing up != Sociology or anthropology degree
- Coming up with an idea != Inventing something
- Knows a programming language != Understands politics
- Loud != Persuasive
- Gets other people to stop talking != Persuasive
- Coding Skill != Talent in Management, Business Development, Marketing, or the practice of Law
- Writes a lot != Writes well
- Funny != Correct
- Similar to me != Correct
- Well known != Respected
- Rude != Honest
- Polite != Honest
- Fast != Smart

I’m sure there’s lots more, but these are the first ones that popped to mind.
