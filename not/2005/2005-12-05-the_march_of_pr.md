I don’t usually ascribe any kind of emotion to corporations, so I was surprised that visiting the [Macromedia homepage](http://www.macromedia.com/) this morning made me sad. “Formerly Macromedia” indeed. But, it seems like it’s only 10% cloud and 90% silver lining, because a quick scan of the new bios reveals that [Kevin Lynch is in charge of PDF and Reader](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/executivebios/kevinlynch.html) in addition to retaining his leadership on Flash. Given that PDF’s always been something of a pain in the ass, despite its usefulness, and that Reader’s user experience has been inconsistent, this could be fantastic news for all of us who love the web and use it all the time.

Now just give me something more reasonable than [these huge, monolithic bundles](http://www.adobe.com/products/bundles/main.html) full of redundant functionality. I know it’s just a quick first step, but I wanna know which tools to bet on!
