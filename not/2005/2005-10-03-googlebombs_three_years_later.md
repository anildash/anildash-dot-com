We’re three (or more) years into the blogosphere’s love for GoogleBombs, and here’s [another story](http://www.detnews.com/2005/technology/0510/02/A23-333865.htm) on them. I’m glad I at least got to throw in a little quote about how people talk about this stuff on the web because… well, because it’s what they *care* about.

In the story, John Hinderaker ludicrously asserts that googlebombs are more popular on one side of the political spectrum than the other. Whether John’s being disingenuous or is merely ill-informed about his compatriots in the blogosphere, it simply ain’t true. It’s very fair to say that googlebombs are more popular amongst web geeks than they are amongst those who aren’t yet online, perhaps that would be a more useful assertion the next time we want to say someone’s above googlebombing.
