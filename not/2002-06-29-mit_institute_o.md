A sign that I roll with a dorky crew: I was quite pleased to get a decent laugh out of [Disco Deejay Cameron "Ladies Love Cool Blogdex" Marlow](http://www.overstated.net) last night with the observation that [M.I.T.](http://www.mit.edu) ought to be a recursive three letter acronym that stands for the M.I.T. Institute of Technology.

All the geekiest jokes have permalinks.
