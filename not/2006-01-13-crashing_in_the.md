Needless to say, after watching [the first season of Lost](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNOG/2020-20) as well as all the episodes of the season thus far, we’ve become fans of the series. I’m not a huge fanboy like [some people](http://sippey.typepad.com/), but it’s cool enough. And hey — an Indian guy in prime time!

So, it’s fun to check out sites like [oceanicairlines.com](http://oceanicairlines.com/). Now I just have to figure out how to get rich by misleading ABC television viewers.
