Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, in their entirety, the lyrics to Hanson’s “[Mmmbop](http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/Hanson%20-%20Mmmbop.mp3)“.

> You have so many relationships in this life
> 
> Only one or two will last
> 
> You go through all the pain and strife
> 
> Then you turn your back and they’re gone so fast
> 
> So hold on to the ones that really care
> 
> ‘Cause in the end they’ll be the only ones there
> 
> And when you get old and start losing your hair
> 
> Tell me who will still care
> 
> Can you tell me who will still care. Oh care
> 
> MMMBop ba du ba dop
> 
> Ba do bop ba du ba dop
> 
> Ba do bop ba du ba dop
> 
> Ba do yah
> 
> MMMBop ba du ba dop
> 
> Ba do bop ba du ba dop
> 
> Ba do bop ba du ba dop
> 
> Ba do yah
> 
> Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
> 
> You can plant any one of those
> 
> Keep planting to find out which one grows
> 
> It’s a secret no one knows
> 
> It’s a secret no one knows, no one knows
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re gone
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re not there
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re gone
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re not there
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re gone
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re not there
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re gone
> 
> In an mmmbop they’re not there
> 
> Can you tell me?
> 
> No you can’t ’cause you don’t know
> 
> Can you tell me?
> 
> You say you can but you don’t know
> 
> Can tell me which flower is gonna grow?
> 
> Can you tell me if it’s gonna be a daisy or a rose?
> 
> Can tell me which flower is gonna grow?
> 
> Can you tell me?
> 
> You say you can but you don’t know
> 
> You say you can but you don’t know
> 
> You don’t know oh, You don’t know oh
