This one time, I got the Outliner virus, and then while I tried to fix it, I used another computer. But I was too much of a douchebag to check if the other computer was vulnerable to Outliner, and sure enough, it *too* got infected. Now everything on my system is wrapped in an unending indented hierarchy. And I have bees in my hair! Aieeee!
