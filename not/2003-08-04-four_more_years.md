I guess it shows how busy I’ve been, but I forgot to mention that last week marked the [fourth anniversary](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/1999/07/index.php) of this here website. Not counting the Daily Links on the side, I’ve posted 1,676 entries, which is a little better than one a day. I’ve made lots of great friends through this weblog, gotten a dream job, and improved my life in countless other immeasurable ways. So thanks to all of you for reading, and let’s hope I haven’t quite peaked yet…
