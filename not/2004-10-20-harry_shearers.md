Longtime actor/comedian/writer Harry Shearer’s done a great job of collecting some classic outsider video/outtakes footage and putting it up on his website, under the heading [Found Objects](http://www.harryshearer.com/found_objects.htm). I’ve always been a fan of this kind of stuff, so it’s great to see someone’s digitized it. You know Shearer as the voice of [Mr. Burns, Flanders, and Principal Skinner](http://www.thesimpsons.com/bios/bios_actors_shearer.htm) or from Spinal Tap.

One of the first outtakes clip sites I’d seen on the web was Tom Garneau’s [Demos from Hell](http://www2.bitstream.net/~tgg/tgg/) on Bitstream Underground. In addition to being a web geek, Garneau used to be an engineer at [Paisley Park](http://www2.bitstream.net/~tgg/tgg/tgg.html).
