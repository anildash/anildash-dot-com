[Donnie asks](http://fasterslower.blogspot.com/2005/08/anil-dash-mr-six-apart.html), “But why is your blog soooo damn ugly man?”

And the answer is, because I am a lousy designer. I’ll probably be updating the site to use the [spiffy new templates](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2005/08/smart_new_templ.html) in Movable Type 3.2 once it’s out.
