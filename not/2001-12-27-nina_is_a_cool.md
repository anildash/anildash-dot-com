[Nina](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.asp?NID=1470) is a cool little font. Itâ€™s like Microsoft [Silkscreen](http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/). And, while

you read about it, now might be a good time for me to point out again that there is an excellent [weblog](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/default.asp) on the Microsoft Typography site.
