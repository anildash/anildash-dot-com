I wish I had gotten a chance to talk to [Ariana](http://www.nubbin.com/) more in Texas, she’s just too goddamned charming. Especially when she comes out about playing a game that I am prone to myself:

> On websites where I know a prompt will appear, I try to predict where the “OK” or default button will be before the page loads. I put my mouse exactly where I think it will be, and then I wait for the prompt window to appear. Like a huntress. In the http darkness.

I’m glad I’m not the only one.
