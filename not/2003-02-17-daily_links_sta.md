Prompted by some questions that people have asked me, I thought I’d throw out some statistics about my [daily links](http://www.dashes.com/links/). I’ve been doing them for about five months, and there are a total of (as I write this) 2078 links. That works out to about 415 a month, or an average of 13 or so per day. Given that I don’t usually do a lot of updating on weekends, it comes in closer to 20 per weekday.

The conclusion? I’m throwing my life away surfing the web, just for you.
