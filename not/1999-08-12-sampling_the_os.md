**A semi-rhetorical question today**: When is the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences](http://www.oscars.org) (the [Oscar](http://www.oscar.com) people) going to have to distinguish what constitutes a "new" film?

For the purposes of the Academy Awards, the Academy already distinguishes what constitutes "new" in regards to songs for film– in 1995, [Coolio](http://www.cooliosofficialwebsite.com/)‘s "Gangsta’s Paradise" was not eligible for nomination for Best Song because it was based on a sample from [Stevie Wonder](http://student-www.uchicago.edu/users/jrgenzen/stevie.html)‘s "Pastime Paradise" off of [*Songs in the Key of Life*](http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?userId=2K1JGR0RT4&amp;mscssid=J3ARWS57ARSH2L1R00CGND08MXWR9538&amp;pCount=0&amp;sRefer=&amp;sourceid=00002634290234003572&amp;ean=737463034029). (Go buy it, it’s a great album…)

The question then becomes, **what constitues an original work in film?** If the Academy had wanted to give the [Star Wars Special Edition](http://www.starwars.com) releases awards for their visual effects in 1997, what would the protocol be? And when some future film is inevitably created from a collage of "samples" of scenes from existing films, what will the industry do?

I suppose we would have already faced this question in the late 80’s in the music industry, if they had been willing to consider [Public Enemy](http://www.publicenemy.com) as being worthy of the Best Album Grammy…
