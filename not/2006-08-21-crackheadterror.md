Whitney Houston, insane former pop star and provider of bail for Bobby Brown, is a remarkable woman. No, not because her most successful song was spun out from a movie where she had to feign affection for Kevin Costner, but because she inspires such a wide variety of men to love her.

Like who? Like **Osama Bin Freaking Laden**! Let’s see what [Page Six](http://www.nypost.com/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm) says:

> Osama bin Laden has more on his mind than just the destruction of the United States – the world’s most wanted terrorist is obsessed with Whitney Houston, so much so that he’s even mulled a hit on her hubby, Bobby Brown.

Oh, *snap*! You don’t want to mess with Bobby Brown. But that’s not the worst foe that Osama would face while wooing Whitney. There’s also the threat of **the undead Serge Gainsbourg** to deal with. The dirty old man of French pop had dibs!

So, I’m thinking reality TV show. Zombie Serge vs. Osama Bin Laden in a stiff competition for Whitney Houston’s crack-addled heart. We could call it *Beating Bobby Brown*. As long as they don’t look at any [recent pictures](http://www.thesuperficial.com/2006/01/16/whitney_houston_still_looks_li.html), it should turn out fine.
