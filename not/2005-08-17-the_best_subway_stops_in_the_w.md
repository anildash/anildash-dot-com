This [fantastic series of photos of subway stations](http://mic-ro.com/metro/metroart.html) really makes me appreciate mass transit in a way that I haven’t in ages. Look at Stockholm!

Any space where people spend a significant amount of time waiting every day should be beautiful. It seems like that’s something people agree on, regardless of what culture they’re from. Thanks to [Byrne](http://www.majordojo.com/) for the link.
