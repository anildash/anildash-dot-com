**Link and Think:**

[![Link and Think](images/linkandthink.gif)](http://www.linkandthink.org/)

Last year, the most useful, most poignant, and most resonant links on World AIDS Day were on [MetaFilterâ€™s Day Without Weblogs page](http://www.metafilter.com/dww.mefi). I am expecting the same will be true this year, so [join the community](http://www.metafilter.com/linkandthink.mefi) in remembrance, observance, and education.
