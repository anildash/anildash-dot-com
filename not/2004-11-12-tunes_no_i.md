Eight years ago, [Tunes.com was offering audio samples](http://news.com.com/Short+Takes+Tunes.com+posts+song+samples/2110-1023_3-246302.html) for 200,000 songs, as part of its attempt to sell downloadable music over the web. What was Apple doing then? [Cybercafes!](http://news.com.com/Apple+cybercafes+due+in+1997/2100-1023_3-245703.html) “The stores also may sell consumer products with Apple logos.” I wonder how that turned out.
