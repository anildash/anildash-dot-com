These days, I think people in traditional media outlets are writing stories just so they’ll get linked on particular blogs.

John Cook [trumping up a fuss](http://www.slate.com/id/2141421/) in Slate about [Sasha](http://www.sashafrerejones.com/) and [Jessica’s](http://tiny.abstractdynamics.org/) analysis of Merritt-ocracy seems like it was written *just so*[Jay](http://www.hiphopmusic.com/) would maybe write a post about it.

The Times’ A.O. Scott seems to have written his [lengthy, amusing slam](http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/movies/18code.html) of *The Da Vinci Code* just so [Matthew](http://www.defectiveyeti.com/) could cover it in the [Bad Review Revue](http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/cat_bad_review_revue.html).

And [three thousand eight hundred words about Michael Jackson’s finances](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/business/yourmoney/14michael.html?ei=5088&amp;en=ca1b4c7af43b7dc0&amp;ex=1305259200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all)? In the Times *Business* section? Clearly that’s written just so I would link to it.
