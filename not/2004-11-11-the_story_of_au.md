Panic’s [story of Audion](http://panic.com/extras/audionstory/) is truly beautiful, a great narrative that can only come from people who love making software. Also not to be missed is the [post from Steve Gedikian](http://gedikian.com/2004/10/i-havent-forgotten-and-we-will-never.html) that’s linked in the post, which is as bittersweet as Panic’s story is sweet. I love reading this stuff.
