**Conflict of interest?**

George, who maintains an excellent blog at [All About George](http://www.allaboutgeorge.com/blog.html), sent me a dollar via PayPal in response to the comments I made earlier about micropayments. (I swear, I wasn’t soliciting!) So I took a look at his site and found a really, really great blog that I never knew existed. And now I feel all dirty like I’m linking to his site because he gave me a dollar. This sucks because he was doing something nice, which called attention to the fact that he has a great site, and now the whole thing is just cheapened by the presence of money. I take it back, never mind all this micropayments bullshit…

Root of all evil, etc.
