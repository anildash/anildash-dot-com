[Steve](http://a.jaundicedeye.com) tells us [Why DHTML Will Win](http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2444/new1020217917753/index.html), and it he bolsters one of my points in [Stories and Tools](http://www.theobvious.com/archive.html?041502), which is that the application development battle is over.
