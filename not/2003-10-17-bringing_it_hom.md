A chance for fabulous cash and prizes! Rich rewards!

We’re looking for a new apartment, here in Manhattan between midtown and roughly Canal Street, with one or two bedrooms so that there’s place to sleep and place to work at home, in a building that allows dogs. I’m checking the usual suspects like Craig’s List and the Village Voice, but if you have a lead on another place that doesn’t require a fee, I’d be more than willing to provide a generous reward. And of course, the sooner you can suggest a place, the better. Just [email me](mailto:anil@dashes.com?subject=apartment) with details.
