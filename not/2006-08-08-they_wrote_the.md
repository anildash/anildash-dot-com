For a long time, I’ve been enamored of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty. There’s a lot of reasons, from their music to their various art projects and media hacks. But the one that’s struck me as most compelling lately is [The Manual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manual). I’d guess the advice contained within would still be effective.
