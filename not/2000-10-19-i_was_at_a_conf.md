I was at a conference yesterday, and got a chance to reiterate why I would always, always, always choose a Microsoft program over an Oracle one for a solution. You see, I don’t subscribe to the "cult of personality" theories where the figurehead of a software company equals the thousands of people who *make up* that company. But I *do* think that corporate culture is influenced by those at the top.

With that in mind, let’s see what [Bill Gates said at the Digital Divide conference](http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20001018S0015), and contrast it to Larry Ellison’s **never having addressed** these issues in public. Ever.
