The household is currently enjoying [Speakerboxxx](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AGWFX/2020-20) and *loving*[The Love Below](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AGWFX/2020-20). Especially "The Way You Move". Fortunately, both albums come together and are as good as everyone asserts. More funk, southern beats, and general depravity seem to be the highlights so far, with the only weak points being the former albumâ€™s occassional dependency on some hip hop cliches.
