During the month of October, I spent at least two days in each of the following cities: Chicago, Toronto, Barcelona, Nice, and Munich. And in between trips I enjoyed the slow-paced, idyllic respite that is life in New York City. On Tuesday, I move my household and all my belongings to a new apartment. And right now my PC has a big dialog box entitled "Moving…." and the status bar says "60 seconds remaining". I hope that’s right.
