Okay, seriously folks, you know I love you, but I do *not* have an in for getting you on the TypePad beta. It’s out of my hands. What I *will* tell you is that you have to [sign up](http://www.typepad.com) if you want to be considered. And you’ll have to fill out a survey. No exceptions. But it’ll all be worth it, I promise!

Now stop emailing me, you greedy bastards.
**Update:** I’m kidding! I kid because I love! I’m as enthusiastic about you guys using TypePad as you are. I’m just feeling bad because I can’t let everyone in. But soon, I promise.
