Those of you attending Friday’s [GEL Conference](http://www.goodexperience.com/gel/) here in New York City who are going to be in town Thursday night might want to join us at the aptly-titled [GEL Conference and Blogger/Industry Networking Cocktails](http://www.camworld.com/party/2003/) which are being held at the [Hudson Bar](http://newyork.citysearch.com/profile/11408323/) Thursday night.

Be sure to RSVP using the form on Cam’s site, and I hope to see you there. Might be a nice stop after [Dinner with Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/04/28#dinnerInNycThursday) at 7pm.
