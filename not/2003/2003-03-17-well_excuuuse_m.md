My, you’re all a sensitive bunch! I wrote a little ha-ha peevish thing yesterday and now everyone thinks I’m mad. This is what I do for *fun*, kids. Since everyone’s having trouble reading my feelings, I am going to have to resort to emoticons. They’re feelings for the Internet!

The first requisite icon when dealing with Anil is the blank-face smiley, depicted with the 😐 symbol. I picked this up on an online community full of people who can appreciate such things. It can mean a few different things, like dead seriousness, or a straight-faced unwillingness to concede the humor of a moment. Deadpan as an emoticon neatly subverts the will of those who normally use emoticons. Take that, you smiley bastards!

Even better was the new smiley that [Jane](http://www.umamitsunami.com) coined last week, the smiley face in air quotes. Behold:

> **":)"**

Insincerity! Mocking! Sarcasm! Spite! Bile! Everything that smiley-users detest. It’s perfectly perfect.

So remember, kids, the next time ole’ Uncle Anil’s talking about "I hate this and that and blah blah blah" make sure to mentally insert a ":)" at the end of it. Kidding? No, I’m only serious! Let others innovate around FOAF and XML and RSD and other random technologies. *I’m* working on helping misanthropes express themselves on the web.
