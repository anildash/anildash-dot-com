I suppose it should just be a music TypeList so I can mention it, but holy crap the hook on Beyonce’s “Crazy In Love” is working. It’s a sample from the Chi-Lites’ “Are You My Woman”, which is not that great a song. (The Chis are known for their ballads for a reason…) Truly elevating the one great part of a sampled track to a new level. Considering how thin Beyonce’s voice is and how fantastically inane the lyrics are, the way the song works is really a tribute to its production. A new high water mark for Rich Harrison.
