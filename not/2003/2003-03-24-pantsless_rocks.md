One of the great things about working at home all day via WiFi is that I get to waste my time in true guy fashion, sitting on the couch surfing the web and watching TV in my boxers. (As opposed to my old job, when I used to sit around the office all day surfing the web on the Village Voice’s dime. In my boxers.) And, when I finally do get my lazy ass off the sofa for the first time all day, it’s to answer the door for the guy delivering dinner.

The danger to this rock star lifestyle? It’s best demonstrated by that hasty glance down before opening the door for the guy with the Chinese food. But I’ve got it covered, because as I started to open the door, she said, "Don’t worry, you’ve got pants on, you can let him in."
