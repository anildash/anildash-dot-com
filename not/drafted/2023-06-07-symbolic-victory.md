# How Prince Became An Icon

On June 7, 1993, his 35th birthday, Prince renamed himself to an unpronounceable symbol, creating the most effective personal logo ever created, and changing culture in the process. This is the story of how Prince iterated on his identity, and his name, for decades, and then at the most fraught point in his career, bet his reputation on a brilliant, risky, and widely-misunderstood move that would come to be synonymous with his work, and that taught a generation of artists and creators about a different way to look at their own power.

After establishing himself throughout the 80s as one of the best-loved and most-successful artists in pop music history, Prince changed his name to a symbol. At the time, this was treated by nearly all media and public discourse as something between a publicity stunt and a nonstop punchline. But 30 years later, it's a move that seems as prescient and thoughtful as Prince's own artistic work. Here’s a look at the artistic, spiritual, cultural, technical and political context behind Prince’s most notorious decision ever.

Oh, and you can download a font of Prince's symbol, too — pulled directly from the message he sent to media on the day he changed his name.

## His Name Is Prince

- You should know that the man was born Prince. Prince Rogers Nelson was the name on his birth certificate, in honor of his father’s stage name. Though he’d redefine his identity more radically than almost any other public figure over the decades that followed, it’s undoubtable that having such a distinct name first set Prince on the path to changing the way pop culture sees names forever, right from the day he was born. And Prince would finish his days wearing the name he was born with. But in between? His name did what no one else’s could ever do.

## Symbolic Origins: Baby I'm A Star

- Prince began creating his mythology in earnest in the early 80s as his star rose from being a powerhouse largely on the Black charts (then even more segregated than music charts today) to an undeniable force on every music platform that existed. The album that marked this inflection point was actually Prince's fifth record: 1982’s _1999_. During this era, Prince began to expand his name, using pseudonyms for work that he produced and composed for other artists like The Time and Vanity 6 — initially under the name “Jamie Starr”, a character whose last name was, of course, a symbol.

The <a href="https://youtu.be/K1cymV4svEU">cover artwork on the landmark _1999_ album</a> was a collage of photos snipped from magazines and his own album covers alongside illustrations hand-drawn by Prince with two of his most enduring muses and collaborators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_(singer)">Vanity</a> (Denise Mathews) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jilldjones/status/923985810298355712">Jill Jones</a>. Prince's records in that era tended to include hints and forward-looking teases at the conceptual ideas he was exploring, a habit that predated by decades the contemporary practice of artists teasing "eras" to their fanbases on social media. Amidst the hidden messages of the 1999 cover (check out “The Revolution” scrawled backwards, hinting at the name he would soon give his band) was a curious amalgam of the traditional symbols for male and female — drawn by Prince himself. This is where most fans first saw the earliest version of what would become Prince's signature symbol.

As Prince’s career took off into the stratosphere, the symbol followed, evolving and adapting to his rising profile and broadening fanbase. 1999 was followed by Purple Rain, a global cultural phenomenon in which Prince dominated radio, album sales, music charts, MTV, movie theaters, magazine covers, and stadiums for nearly two straight years. Through that period, the symbol popped up everywhere, in ways both subtle and obvious. Right on the Purple Rain album cover photo (thanks to being painted on Prince’s motorcycle), spray painted on an overpass in the music video for When Doves Cry (the biggest song of 1984), or featured on the record sleeves of multiple massive hit singles, fans couldn’t miss the blatant symbolism.

This basic male/female symbol would remain present in minor ways for the rest of Prince's extraordinary hit run in the 80s, but with less prominence than during the omnipresent _Purple Rain_ era, until Prince decided in 1990 to release _Graffiti Bridge_, a semi-sequel to the hit film. Suddenly, the symbol was everywhere again, this time even incorporated directly into Prince’s clothing. The subsequent tour brought the symbol to center stage in Prince’s iconography for the first time, now embellished with some adornments that evoked the hair metal trappings of the era. This continued through the following year’s massive “Diamonds & Pearls” album and tour, which returned Prince to commercial relevance and cemented the symbol as a prominent and permanent part of Prince’s public identity. The symbol was evolving in its visual design, and coming into its own. It was, in modern parlance, now part of Prince’s “brand”.

## What's My Name

The thing you need to know about Prince, especially in the 80s as he reached his commercial peak, is that he was _always_ deliberately constructing his personal mythology. He played with ambiguity over his race, even though he was incontrovertibly Black, both as a challenge to the systemic racism of the music industry and the pervasive racism of American society, as well as a tactical way of broadening his appeal to a white audience (and white-owned media) that typically refused to embrace Black pop stars.

Prince's lyrics of the era provided useful clues for why he might embrace a challengingly ambiguous identity. On 1981's _Controversy_, the driving title track famously featured Prince asking, "Am I Black or white, am I straight, or gay?". By 1984's unapologetically messianic "I Would Die 4 U" on _Purple Rain_, Prince said "I'm not a woman, I'm not a man. I am something that u'll never understand." It's hard to overstate how truly fearless it was for a Black man to stand on the biggest stages in America at the height of the Reagan era and unapologetically embrace his androgyny, or _any_ kind of complexity in a cultural moment that brutally punished nonconformity. Prince's lyrical content (and general creative courage) literally inspired a Congressional inquiry, with Tipper Gore leading a moral panic that culminated in Parental Advisory stickers being plastered on every good album of the era — directly inspired by members of Congress having had to endure the inarguable reality that their kids loved Prince's music. 

It was in _that_ context that Prince began to feature a logo that the Christian nationalists of the era predictably described as "satanic". But Prince was just getting started.

## Release It

While his star was on the rise throughout the 80s, Prince was chafing behind the scenes at the constraints of the traditional record industry. He was such a prodigious musician (during peak times of productivity, it was common for Prince to record nearly 200 songs in a single year) that releasing material at the one-album-every-few-years pace of other pop superstars felt like being shackled. Other major stars of the era, like Madonna or Michael Jackson, would release an album, and then slowly trickle out singles and videos and maybe a tour over the next few years. Prince released an album every year like clockwork under his own name, and then cheated these constraints in nearly every way possible on top of that.

Prince made albums for protégés and alter egos and bands where every song was written and composed and performed by Prince with only minimal input from the artist whose name was on the cover. He ghost-wrote songs for everyone from Kenny Rogers to The Bangles. He dropped his follow-up records as quickly as he could possibly release them, even if the prior record was still a huge hit that any other artist would have milked for years. (_Around the World In a Day_, the follow-up to _Purple Rain_, was released just _two weeks_ after the end of the Purple Rain tour.) Signature albums like _1999_ were actually double-albums, and nearly every single of the era featured an original b-side composition that was every bit as good as the album tracks, as just another way of getting more material out to fans. Prince even tried to release a _triple_ album in 1987 before having it pared back by his label Warner Brothers into the double-album masterpiece _Sign O The Times_. The reticence of a major label to flood the market with multiple albums a year from a top-tier artist may have been entirely understandable from a commercial standpoint, but it was also inarguably a stifling constraint to put on one of their biggest and most lucrative artists.

This tension was clearly on Prince’s mind at the turn of the 90s when another major shift happened in the pop music market. An arms race erupted amongst the very top tier of pop artists for who could snag the most massive recording contract. Janet Jackson got $40M to go to Virgin. Michael Jackson raised the stakes with $60M to re-sign with Epic. And Prince, hot off the success of his commercial resurgence with _Diamonds & Pearls_, decided to top them all with a grand announcement of a $100M deal, which made him a Vice President of Warner Brothers Records and promised to fund his iniatives like a vanity label (heh), further films, and other ancillary projects. Now, like the other contracts, arguably much of the headline dollar amount was puffery based on the most optimistic predictions possible, but it spoke to the mania of the moment that Prince would even _want_ to put out a <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/09/04/Prince-signs-100-million-deal-with-Warner-Bros/6486715579200/">press release</a> in which becoming a VP of a media conglomerate was somehow seen as cool.

Prince seemed to initially buy into the promise of this new phase of his career, as he tried his hands at new endeavors like teaming up with the Joffrey Ballet, creating comic books, or opening up a chain of nightclubs in Minneapolis, Miami and Los Angeles. Just after culminating this fertile phase with the announcement of his blockbuster new contract, Prince released his 14th album in October of 1992, with a most peculiar title.

Birth of an Icon

Fans had gotten a hint that Prince was taking his long-featured symbol in new directions in June of 1992, when he celebrated his 34th birthday by surprise-releasing a promotional 12” of a sizzling new song, “Sexy MF”. This was followed by a video single release on VHS tape (since MTV would obviously never play a song whose chorus consisted of the phrase “you sexy motherfucker”), which had a full-length video for the song and explained it was from “The Funky New Album, Entitled…” followed by a 3D animated version of the symbol, now adorned with a horn-like swoosh and accompanied only with the sound of a metallic clank, indicating there was no human pronunciation for the symbol. (Prince being Prince, this announcement of the album was then followed by an ad for the upcoming release of an album… from his then-newest protégée, Carmen Electra.)

[tk symbol intro video]

No further explanation of the symbol’s origin or the new swooshy modifications were offered at that time, and except for noting that it had no pronunciation, little additional information was added even as the album of that title was released in the fall of 1992. The databases used by record stores of the time listed the album name as “Love Symbol” or other similar substitute titles, coming up with solutions they hadn’t had to reckon with since Led Zeppelin IV. Fans noticed that his familiar symbol had now grown a horn, and could only guess as to how the evolution happened. But back in Minneapolis, the symbol had been gestating for 6 months.

A team of artists had been working since early in 1992 on a set of animated graphics to accompany the music videos Prince was recording at the time. And in the midst of that work, they created an icon for the ages.

Thanks to technician Dale Hughes, we have extraordinarily detailed documentation of the technical process of creating the new symbol, including the first time Prince ever saw his signature symbol:

Hughes goes deep on the technical aspects of the rendering of the symbol, using then-new 3D graphics techniques. Geeks shouldn’t miss Hughes’ javascript 3D renderer & how he revived these old models. But longtime Prince designer Lizz Frey offers more insights into the most significant graphical change, the addition of the swoosh that elevated the mark from a simple male/female symbol. It seems that after seeing Frey's swooping "7" in her distinctive writing, Prince amended the symbol he’d been using for years.

The design finalized, the new symbol began to take on a life of its own, becoming an album title that fall of 1992, and then the following June, a year after the release of Sexy MF, on Prince’s 35th birthday, he did the impossible.

The Announcement

June 7, 1993: the press release was short and sweet. Prince had, it asserted, legally changed his name to the unpronounceable symbol which had been the title of his previous album. No justification or explanation was offered. But before the speculation began, there was the matter of executing the audacious and absurd plan.

Prince’s team at Paisley Park scrambled to enable media to appropriately cover the story. Computers of the time were just newly able to render custom fonts that could be installed by users, and Prince obliged by having his staff provide print media with floppy discs containing a simple new font that contained only one glyph: his symbol.

Later, the symbol font would be distributed on the online services that predated widespread access to the World Wide Web, including CompuServe and America Online, and it would even be bundled with Prince’s 1994 CD-ROM, “Interactive”. Font in hand, journalists immediately set about reporting on the news of Prince’s mysterious and inexplicable name change, and his rumored retirement just a few months after signing what was promoted as the biggest recording contract of all time.

It is perhaps no coincidence that this moment also marked the flourishing of the first passionate online communities of Prince fans. An early email list, the Prince Mailing List, was booming. Prince-themed chat rooms popped up on the then-popular Prodigy dial-up service, and later spread to AOL and other services. The alt.music.prince newsgroup (an early, pre-web form of online discussion group) was formed just a month before the name change and immediately took off.

In each of these new communities, the same topics were explosively popular: What did this name change mean? Was Prince really retiring? Does anybody have a copy of the font?

Warner Brothers seemed as confused as anyone about what the move signified, and they killed time by releasing a greatest hits package, which didn’t explain the name change but confirmed that Prince had at least ostensibly retired, and reified the sense that a new chapter in Prince’s career was beginning.

Interactive

Prince began experimenting with new ways of reaching his audience. He had recently teamed up on a ballet performance with the Joffrey Ballet, and he doubled down on exploring new forms by composing songs for a musical version of James Brooks’ film “I’ll Do Anything”, later re-edited to remove the musical elements. Prince staged a not-very-coherent rock opera version of Homer’s Odyssey, and experimented with the then-new format of CD-ROM by releasing “Interactive”, a pastiche of the era’s biggest CD-ROM hit, Myst, but set in a stylized version of Prince’s studio, in a virtual building shaped like the symbol. The production team behind the CD-ROM nervously replaced every mention of “Prince” with the symbol, resulting in absurdities like saying that O(+> starred in Purple Rain.

Soon, Prince settled on a simpler story for attributing his work: His legacy work like albums and films were credited to Prince, including music he retrieved from his legendary vault of unreleased recordings. His new stuff was by O(+>. And Prince? Prince was dead. The artwork of his 1994 vault release, Come, confirmed it, clearly stating “Prince: 1958 — 1993”. He released his first big hit in years, “The Most Beautiful Girl In The World” under his new name — and under an independent label, not Warner Brothers.

He swore to play only his new material and nothing by his old, dead identity. When he took the stage at the 1994 European MTV Awards, he opened a scorching performance by acknowledging artists like George Michael who were feuding with their record labels, and stridently declared “Death to Prince.”. And then he immediately played “Peach”, a Prince song.

Formerly Known

By 1994, the success of “The Most Beautiful Girl In The World” and the incoherence of Prince’s explanations led to mainstream media writers coining the phrase “the artist formerly known as Prince” to refer to the man, and the phrase was used by his own publicists of the time despite his disavowal of the unwieldy moniker and his open disdain for the ugly abbreviation it spawned, TAFKAP.

Most media also took the name change as incontrovertible evidence that Prince had lost the plot. Variations on “formerly relevant” or “formerly sane” (the mid-90s were a much worse time for sensitivity to ableism) were rampant, and many outlets flat out refused to honor the name change at all.
