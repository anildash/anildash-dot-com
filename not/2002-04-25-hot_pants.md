There are some sublime pleasures to this Internet thing. Like I can be browsing around [Garretâ€™s site](http://www.dangerousmeta.com/posts/02/20020424) and notice that he points out that [hot pants](http://www.style.com/fashionshows/hunter/041702/index.html) are scheduled to be the next inane fashion trend this fall, and then I can reflect on the fact that I live basically down the street from the [Elite offices](http://209.208.170.247/servlet/AgencyInfo?siteId=5736) and then I can just go to sleep a happy man.
