The big problem is that most Americans don’t actually *follow the lead* of the people whom we’ve picked to *be our leaders* when they [present a good example](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4325585.stm). I am always surprised that political extremists can be civil to their family members who disagree with them politically, but have to flame the crap out of people online whom they’ve never met and don’t know anything about, but think they have a political disagreement with.

There’s still [lots of people](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/16023) who are interested in honest intellectual discourse with people on the other side of the aisle. And the radical moderates *are* winning, long-term, against the extremists. I just wanted to post a little reminder for the other moderates out there, since we haven’t been particularly effective in promoting our successes.
