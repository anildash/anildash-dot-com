Stewart posits a [generic interface between games](http://www.sylloge.com/personal/2002_07_01_s.html#79246456), and the implications are mind-bending and potentially quite fun:

> Use this system as an intermediary for allowing two people to play two different games against one anotherâ€¦ while expressing the strategy of their play in one space into an entirely different system/structure.
