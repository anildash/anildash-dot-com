Do you remember a couple of years ago when that Sean Lennon album came out, and it was on Grand Royal and you checked it out, and there were some good songs on it, but it wasn’t *that* great? And you kind of felt bad because you didn’t like it more, even though at the time you thought you did? And then the Beasties put that "I Don’t Know" song on *Hello Nasty* and it was in the same vein, but better?

Yeah, me too.
