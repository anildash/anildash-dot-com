**Things That Are Funny:**

- Old people swearing
- Children swearing
- Fart jokes
- Any guy getting hit in the crotch by any object
- Reciting song lyrics deadpan as conversation
- Miming a "drinking" motion while someone talks, to indicate that they are an alcoholic and are thus not to be taken seriously
