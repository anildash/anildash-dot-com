There’s been a great hue and cry about the debate over the definition of the word “planet”, and Pluto’s recent change in status. Frankly, I think the whole thing is silly — like a lot of words, “planet” means different things to scientists than to lay people, and that’s where the drama comes in.

But the uproar has inspired something pretty amazing. Mike Pusateri, proprietor of the venerable blog Cruftbox, organized the [Pluto is a Planet Protest](http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001332.html).

Mike’s protest was inspired, enlisting the help of his children and his friends to raise awareness of the cause and culminating in the creation of [an amazing video](http://cruftbox.vox.com/library/post/pluto-is-a-planet-protest.html) over on Vox. I had been unmoved by the debate thus far, but now I’m convinced of the danger — Uranus is next!
