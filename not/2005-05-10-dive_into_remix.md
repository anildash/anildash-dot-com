I’m really enjoying the new toys I’m playing with on websites these days. As always, I wrote ’em up on [the Six Apart site](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2005/05/rip_mix_and_b.html). (The Professional Network [blog](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/) is where an average of two posts a day have escaped the black hole for the better part of a year now.)
