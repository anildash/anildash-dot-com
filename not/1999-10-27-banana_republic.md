File this under "So scary it must be true". [Banana Republic](http://www.bananarepublic.com)‘s flagship store in Manhattan opened the other day (yesterday, I think) and they offer **two new services** from the store concierge that make me excited and terrified, respectively.

The first service, which piqued my interest though I own a Windows CE-based [Philips Nino](http://nino.philips.com), is downloadable maps of the store for the [Palm](http://www.palm.com) organizers. I don’t know how necessary that is for one store, but I distinctly recall being in a large mall in Westchester County a week ago and wishing for *exactly* that service. Especially since I **didn’t know my way around** the mall and it was huge and I was in a hurry to find the store I wanted.

Maybe the [Mall of America](http://www.mallofamerica.com) could give those to shoppers on their way in? I’m surprised more computer conventions don’t offer the same thing so geeks can download [Comdex](http://www.comdex.com) and [Internet World](http://www.internetworld.com) maps when they’re at the shows.

The second idea at Banana Republic illustrates exactly what I find most repulsive about its customers, and by extension, the store itself. The service? **Cell phone recharging**. Now I understand I take the risk of alienating every reader of this page by saying that **I hate cell phones**, but I find the idea of placing your StarTac in a cradle while you shop (presumably so you can yap even more en route to the Starbucks around the corner when you leave) to be just plain icky.

But at least I have the consolation of knowing all the cell phone users will get **brain cancer**. Hey, that’s not funny…
