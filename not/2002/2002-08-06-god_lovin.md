I went to buy a sandwich tonight and the young muslim boy behind the counter was making a concerted, but not entirely successful, attempt not to laugh as he asked me why I was wearing a "Jews for Jesus" t-shirt.

Even more kindly, he nodded sagely and said "oh" when I told him that it was the only clean shirt I had left, as if that had been a satisfactory answer to his question. I could almost hear him thinking, "Funny, he doesn’t *look*…"
