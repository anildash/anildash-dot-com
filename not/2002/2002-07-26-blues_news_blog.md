[Andre](http://www.torrez.org) kindly pointed out this [weblog of Quake news](http://www.bluesnews.com/archives/july96.html) from Blue’s News circa July 1996. I’ve always wondered why Stephen Heaslip deliberately gets written out of some people’s history of weblogs, and I can’t help but surmise that it must be a concerted effort to slight him, planned and executed by people who are out to get him.

I could be wrong.
