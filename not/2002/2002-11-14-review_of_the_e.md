New in [Magazine](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/), a [review of *The Elements of User Experience*](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/review_the_elements_of_user_experience.php), JJG’s [new book](http://www.jjg.net/elements/). Yes, he’s a friend. Yes, I (mostly) praise the book. That’s because it’s good.

Also in the magazine is a totally revamped version of [Introducing the Microcontent Client](http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/introducing_the_microcontent_client.php). (Should I have called it "Reintroducing"?) The article needed a lot of updates to reflect the many changes in this realm in the past 3 weeks, along with the terrific number of high quality comments I’ve gotten on the piece, including some priceless insights from [Ian Oeschger](http://www.brownhen.com/2002_10_20_backhen.html#83468153) and [Andrew Wooldridge](http://cogworks.manilasites.com/), both of whom work on Mozilla and gave me a lot of insight into the practicalities of creating the application we’ve all been trying to define.

There are two more stories coming up for the magazine that have stalled a bit. I hope to have them done soon. And finally, I did some updates to my [about page](http://www.dashes.com/anil/?about), which has devolved into shameless self-promotion. But why be shy about self-indulgence on a weblog that I’ve named after myself, right? Stay tuned as I finish a list of the Top 100 Reasons I Love Myself.
