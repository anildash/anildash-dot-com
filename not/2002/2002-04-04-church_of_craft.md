For all the people who’ve ever asked me how I can consider myself spiritual when I don’t believe in religions or gods, and for all the people who’ve always understood exactly what I meant, I should revise my position a bit. I finally found a church I would be willing to belong to. Seriously.

Witness the [Church of Craft](http://www.churchofcraft.org/index4.html). This makes sense to me.
