You have just been hit with an AIM snow ball! It’s the start of…. Snow Ball Fight 2002-2003 One rule to this game…. You can’t hit some one who has already hit you! Now… go out there and hit as many people as you can before they get you! I got you first! And you can’t get me back.

You have just been hit with a big brown AIM ass! You can kiss my big brown ass, or pass it along to someone else with an equally hateful demeanor!
