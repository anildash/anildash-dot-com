Partial transcript of an Actual Phone Call from one of the crazy people at our office:

> Remember what the doctor said? Well, y’know how he said not to eat anything (unintelligible mumbling about surgery, presumably)? I ate a piece of pizza. and you know the cheese between my teeth? There’s cheese between my teeth.

As our webmaster said in response, "I love my job."
