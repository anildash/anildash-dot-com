So, in the shower this morning, I was thinking that I need a loofah. Because, ya know, sometimes a fella needs a loofah. And, as has been documented by such poet-philosophers as [Perry Farrell](http://www.reallyrics.com/lyrics/J000800020005.asp), the shower lends itself to a bit of contemplation. I started to marvel about how loofahs are only really useful in the presence of water.

Also, like a lot of people, I’m prone to singing in the shower. The acoustics of the tiles have me falsely convinced that my singing voice is something less than awful. Thus, needless to say, the ideas in my head combined with my musical propensities and I ended up in the shower singing, “The loofah! The loofah! The loofah’s on fire! We don’t need no water…”

And I wonder why I’m still single.
