Keep it on the down-low: [Instructions for enabling](http://toolbar.google.com/dc/aboutdc.html) the [Google Compute](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2002_02_01_archive.php#10236011) feature of your Google toolbar. Most of us don’t have the option yet, as [the FAQ says](http://toolbar.google.com/dc/faq_dc.html#25), “At this time, the Google Compute feature is only available to a small number of randomly selected Google Toolbar users.”

Don’t say I never did nothin’ for ya.
