My favorite site on the web right now is [muxway](http://www.muxway.org/), which Joshua Schachter has created as a database of (just barely) categorized links. You know Joshua’s work from the venerable [memepool](http://www.memepool.com), but this site might be even better.

To view the list by category, just click the category name after one of the links. They’re self-explanatory, except that “tl” stands for timeline, which is a big timeline of computing that is still a work in progress.

**Caution:** Do *not* follow the link to muxway if you have any deadlines looming. You have been warned.
