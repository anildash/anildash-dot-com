Those of you still mourning the passing of [Ad Critic](http://www.adcritic.com) might want to peruse the (lackluster, but promising) offerings at [AdReview](http://adreview.com) and [AdForum](http://adforum.com). There are also a good variety of ads rotating through the features at [AdAge Global](http://www.adageglobal.com/). Particularly interesting to me was [Commercial Closet](http://www.commercialcloset.org/cgi-bin/iowa/index.html), an outstanding collection of gay-inclusive or -targeted ads.

While researching this stuff I found [AdWeak](http://www.adweak.com/), which name is unfortunately largely accurate as a description of its parodic attempts at the expense of [AdWeek](http://www.adweek.com), but it’s still good for a once-over and a quick laugh. As far as advertising journalism goes, I still think one of the best resources around is [Stewart Elliot’s "In Advertising" newsletter](http://www.nytimes.com/mem/email.html) ([sample](http://www.nytimes.com/info/help/email/InAdvertising.html)) for the New York Times. It’s mentioned in passing in [this article](http://www.atnewyork.com/news/article/0,1471,8471_896841,00.html) as "[we]blogging by email" and that seems a pretty apt description.

And I remember reading an infrequent advertising column in the Money section of USA Today when I was a kid, does anybody know if that’s still around?
