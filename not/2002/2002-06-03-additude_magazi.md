I saw a copy of [ADDitude Magazine](http://www.additudemag.com/) at a newsstand yesterday (incidentally, shelved next to a copy of [*Jane*](http://www.additudemag.com/additude.asp?DEPT_NO=103&amp;SUB_NO=10)) and I flipped through it out of curiosity, as I didn’t know there was a magazine for people with attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder.

And then I thought, “Aren’t these articles a little *long*?”
