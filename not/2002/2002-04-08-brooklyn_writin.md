Sunday afternoon found me speaking to the inestimable [Mr. Ford](http://www.ftrain.com/), and I had to note my frustration at his, and other, Brooklyn-based web projects populated with authors (their names either unlikely or pseudonymous) carefully framing their meticulous line drawings with flowery prose laden with turn-of-the-last-century verbal tics. Each piece, naturally, prefaced with ornamentation like "In which…" and "Please find…".

There are [many](http://www.americanbookcongress.org/), [many](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/) such [endeavors](http://www.themorningnews.org/), of course. I postulated that all of the linguistic adornment was a ruse to hide their feelings of inadequacy for living in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan. I am fairly certain that my little jab was facetious. But then Paul slapped me, and I was chastened. I suppose some humor just pushes the boundaries too far.

Later, I learned that [Manhattan is the new Brooklyn](http://www.timeoutny.com/340.cover.big.jpg) and somehow the whole day, the japery, the violence… it all made sense. My ass is the new magazine headline.
