In NYC and too cheap for [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com)? This tip, courtesy of the still-aborning [SkyBlack](http://www.skyblack.com): Use the [New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org)‘s [LEO service](http://webpac.nypl.org/leo.html) to put a DVD on hold. They’ll email you once the disc is available, and then you just walk by your [local branch](http://www.nypl.org/hours/) and pick up your movie, *for free*. Are you not just super cheap, but geeky too? Use the [telnet interface](telnet://nyplgate.nypl.org/) to the service and laugh at the lusers slogging through the Java version.
