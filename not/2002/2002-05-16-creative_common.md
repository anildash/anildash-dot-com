[Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) launched today. From the site:

> Creative Commons is a non-profit organization founded on the notion that some people would prefer to share their creative works (and the power to copy, modify, and distribute their works) instead of exercising all of the restrictions of copyright law.

Congratulations to [Matt](http://haughey.com) for an excellent design for an important idea.
