Well, as of when you read this, I’ll be on the left coast. Fresh content will thusly be sporadic, but I’ve set up some pre-written entries to tide you over the next few days. And hopefully I’ll have time to make some appearances in person.

Those of you going to SXSW this weekend can take another look at the [KICK!](__GHOST_URL__/kick) site, for the kickball game I’m hosting this weekend, as there have been a number of small updates. Sign up for the email list there, too, if you want to get any last-minute updates on the game in your inbox.
