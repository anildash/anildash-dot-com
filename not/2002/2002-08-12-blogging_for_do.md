Meg makes the arugment in [Blogging for Dollars](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/08/12/megnut.html) that the weblog world needs professionally paid webloggers in order to advance past the labor-of-love ghetto: "The idea here is to find an enthusiast, empower them, and fund them."

Sheâ€™s absolutely right, of course, but the biggest obstacle to this progress is going to be the fact that effective blogging in an enterprise or commercial environment requires a breadth of access and network of contacts that would make the weblogger an effective ombudsman for an organization. Media companies have enough trouble accepting the value and importance of such a position, other industries will face even more inertia and reluctance in their efforts, especially if the company is publicly traded.
