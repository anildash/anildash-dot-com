Terrific interview of Cornell West on [the Tavis Smiley Show](http://search.npr.org/cf/cmn/cmnpd01fm.cfm?PrgDate=6%2F26%2F2002&amp;PrgID=14) where they discuss an event Prince is hosting at his studios in Minnesota, including not just musical performances, but a discussion on race, xenophobia, and artists’ and consumers’ rights vs. the music industry. I find it enchanting that a Princeton professor is talking to a little man in high heels about these things.
