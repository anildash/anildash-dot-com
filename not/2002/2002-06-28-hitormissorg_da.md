In the vein of Dan’s [BlogTracker](http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/), [Matt](http://hit-or-miss.org/) has made a cool Perl script called [Daily Crawl](http://hit-or-miss.org/projects/dailycrawl/) that lets you host your update list on your own server.

I’d probably be using it right now, if not for some Perl problems that also kept me from doing most tests of the remarkable new version 2.2 of [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/). TrackBack is cool as hell.
