Liz nails [one of my recurrent peeves](http://capitalinflux.blogspot.com/?/2002_05_01_capitalinflux_archive.html) about people who consider themselves entrepreneurs these days:

> It amazes me that people have such short memories. There was a time, not so long ago, when VCs were the lender of last resort for entrepreneurs. If you were going to start a company, you “bootstrapped” it. If you couldn’t bootstrap it, you applied for a bank loan. If you couldn’t get a bank loan, you *might* start to think about equity financing.

Goddamn right. Real business don’t *take* money, they *make* money.
