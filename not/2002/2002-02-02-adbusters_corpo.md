I’ve had the [corporate U.S. Flag](https://secure.adbusters.org/orders/flag/) postcards for years, but it was still dramatic to see the [giant ad in Times Square](http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/flag/nyc.html) tonight, especially on the way to a James Brown concert (more on that later) that featured James singing “Living in America” accompanied by two dancing girls in star-spangled bikinis, literally wrapped in the flag.
