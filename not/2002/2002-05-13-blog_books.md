As part of a the weblog world, I realize we are the most narcissistically self-obsessed group ever. (Except for all other forms of media, at least.) But I still think it’s cool that there’s a [glut of weblog books](http://www.microcontentnews.com/entries/20020509-734.htm) coming out in the next few months. Even better, several of the authors are friends of mine, and while they’ve all been reluctant to announce their pending projects, I can shamelessly announce mine: I am trying to get mentioned in all of the books being published.

That’s *waaaay* cooler than link-whoring.
