I’m kinda perplexed why CNET’s download site lets people post spam tools in their [email utilities](http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0,10151,0-3356723-106-0-1-0,00.html?tag=st.dl.10063.dir.3356723) section. You get descriptions like:

> [AnyMailer](http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-3356723-100-9421067.html?tag=st.dl.3356723-106-8.lst-9-2.9421067) is bulk email software based on unique know-how sending technology, providing real anonymous instant delivery. You can forget your problems with ISP’s – your IP address will never be shown in email headers.

It will also extract e-mails that are not visible on the page but hidden in the code. Save in comma delimited or line break format.

Bastards.
