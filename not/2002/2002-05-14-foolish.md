When we were walking around, I was humming to myself, and she asked what I was humming, and I said, “Nothing, just humming.” Because I didn’t want to feel foolish if she found out that I was humming one of the songs she sent me. Then, when she asked how long it had been, I didn’t admit that I knew, down to the day. Because I didn’t want to feel foolish if she found out I was that far gone. I am considering now that, one of these days, I’ll have convinced her I’m not a hopeless romantic, that I don’t revel in the details, that I’m really not the man I am, whom she loves.

So I kinda feel foolish.
