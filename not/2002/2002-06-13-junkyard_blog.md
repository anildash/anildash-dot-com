Bryan at [JunkYard Blog](http://junkyardblog.blogspot.com/2002_06_09_junkyardblog_archive.html#77607189) mentioned a similarity in the photos of the John Doe #2 suspect from the Oklahoma City bombing and Jose Padilla. I caught a reference to it from the comments that Dan made over at [Lake Effect](http://www.lakefx.nu/archive/2002_06_09_index.html#77639163). And then it shows up today as an online-only article at [the Voice](http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0225/ridgeway3.php). Itâ€™s fun to track memes, especially when they end up at my office.
