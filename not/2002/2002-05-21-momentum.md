Momentum’s building against the copyright and control fascists. We’ve already seen it from the consumer side. And the efforts from the side of the creators and artists is getting more organized, too. Witness [Artist Network](http://www.artistnetwork.com/), with investors including, interestingly, [Paul Allen](http://paulallen.com). I always knew he was one of the good guys.
