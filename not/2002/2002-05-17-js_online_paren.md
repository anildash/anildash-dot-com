Today I added my first article to the list of headline links on the [Voice](http://villagevoice.com) homepage. It’s a blog of sorts. The link text? “[Parents Say Kiddie Thong by Abercrombie Is Just Plain Wrong](http://www.villagevoice.com/xrd.php?url=www.jsonline.com/news/gen/may02/43941.asp)“

My mom must be so proud. Whatever you do, *don’t* follow that link. And after you do, *don’t* click on the picture in the article to see a larger version of the photo.
