[The New Yorker](http://newyorker.com/printable/?fact/020715fa_fact1) discusses Superman Lance Armstrong:

> Lance Armstrong’s heart is almost a third larger than that of an average man. During those rare moments when he is at rest, it beats about thirty-two times a minute — slowly enough so that a doctor who knew nothing about him would call a hospital as soon as he heard it. (When Armstrong is exerting himself, his heart rate can edge up above two hundred beats a minute.)

Thirty-two BPM at rest?! This guy’s a machine. It makes me wonder when the first athletes will be disqualified from international competition for mechanical enhancements, like nanotech implants or perfomance-enhancing machinery.
