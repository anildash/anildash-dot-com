Weblog author extraordinaire (and one of the nicest people I know all around) [Rebecca Blood](http://rebeccablood.net) has finally [announced](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2002/01.html#22a) her [book on creating a weblog](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/073820756X/rebeccaspocke-20). I’d buy anything RCB would write, but you should buy it because there’s really no one in the world better qualified to write about the subject.

Of course, my interest runs more towards the book about [how weblogs affect culture](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738207411/rebeccaspocke-20), but I’m betting they’ll both be compelling.
