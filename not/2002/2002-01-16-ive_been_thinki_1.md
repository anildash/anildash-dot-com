I’ve been thinking about this one for a while: I want to be able to import all of the birthdays for the people on my Amazon [Friends and Favorites list](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-favorites/-/A3PXSQN7TSQTGQ/104-5509954-6374326) into my PIM and PDA. A coupla clicks and I’ve got a [vCalendar](http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcaloverview.html) entry, like [Evite](http://evite.com) uses, and I can have my PocketPC or Palm or whatever remind me to order birthday presents or anniversary gifts for people. Maybe even including a link to their wishlists.

What do you think?
