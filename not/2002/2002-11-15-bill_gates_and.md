You know, Bill Gates had a public appearance next to a giant inflated condom more than 24 hours ago, presumably with a dot on his forehead as he’s been wearing during most of his trip in India, and yet there are *still* no pictures of this event on the Internet a full day later.

The curious absence of this photograph is the first sign I’ve seen that the Internet might be dying. Isn’t this sort of thing the reason the good lord gave us Google and the Web? I might as well be reading dead trees.
