Corrections and clarifications: Heather meant I was an asshole in a nice way! I knew that, I just wanted to make sure you did. And Lane’s lips aren’t loose, why they’re gasket-tight! O-ring tight. Ahem. Also, I haven’t heard from Peter, but I don’t think he *actually* wants me dead. Meg was only joking when she said I ruined her panels. Also, apparently, I still have a crush on Alison.

The part about the lousy photographs? True, alas.
