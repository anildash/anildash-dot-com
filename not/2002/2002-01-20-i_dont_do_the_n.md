I don’t do the New Year’s Resolution thing, but if I did, I’d use [Stan’s](http://www.turbanhead.com/archives/2002_01_13_arc.html#8752231). **Addendum:** And he keeps it all the way real by breaking down [white folk smell](http://www.turbanhead.com/archives/2002_01_20_arc.html#8902049). We haven’t been meaning to keep it secret, but you know how it is…

Don’t get upset now, someday I’ll publish my screed on how I hate being next to some stank-like-curry polyester shirt-wearin’ subcontinental sumbitch on the subway and everybody lookin’ at me like, "Tell your brother right there he need a baa-*ath*. I ain’t talkin’ about ‘rinse that off in the shower’, I’m talkin’ about ‘scrub that nasty funk right off in the tub’."

All I can do is the little sideways step and shake my head, hoping they can hear me thinking, "He’s not with me, I don’t know the man. I’m all dressed GQ, I smell like Downy! I ain’t the one!"

Sigh. This world is full of those little cultural misunderstandings.
