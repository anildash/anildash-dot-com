The highest ideal of the Internet, for me, is to use all this technology and magic as a tool for communication. Taking theory into practice, we find sites like [bitterlemons.org](http://www.bitterlemons.org/about/about.html) and [DialogNow](http://www.dialognow.org/special/faq), which are first tentative steps towards using this network for work of actual importance.
