“[The blogs are just a wonderful thing about the Web–you know, individual people just starting up their own Web sites](http://news.com.com/2008-1082-838894.html),” former editor of [Slate](http://www.slate.com), Michael Kinsley. I’ve loved Slate since it launched, though I seldom read it anymore.

Does anyone have a link to the Slate article where they discussed confusion between their “The Fray” discussion boards and [Derek](http://www.powazek.com)‘s [Fray](http://www.fray.com)? It woulda been early ’97, as I recall, and the old-school net users’ Microsoft bashing was classic. Pity that’s not archived.
