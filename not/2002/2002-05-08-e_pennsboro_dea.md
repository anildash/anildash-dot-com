The tiny school district where I went for my entire education has been the scene of [six unusual student deaths](http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/10207638292419211.xml) in the past few months. The disparate causes of the deaths (an aneurysm, cancers, heart attacks, lung disorders) indicate that they’re all unrelated, which makes the fear even worse for the community. While I didn’t, despite a handful of excellent teachers, really enjoy the place much when I was there, I can’t imagine what could be harder for that group of small towns to deal with, and I wish them well.

That is, except for the church that I drove by when I visited, the place where I used to have my Cub Scout meetings as a child. Their marquee out front read, “Coincidences are when God decides to remain anonymous.” I am wondering what, exactly, that means.
