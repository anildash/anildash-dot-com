Okay, enough talk about ugliness. Let’s try out [Google’s new IM service before it launches tomorrow](http://thousandrobots.com/blog/archives/2005/08/using_googles_n.php)!

Yay for people figuring things out. I’d feel bad for Google’s PR department that things are leaking out (I’m sure they have a much more interesting, pigeon-powered description of the service) but on the other hand, this can’t be bad for buzz.
