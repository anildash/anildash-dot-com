So I added this [Human Click](http://www.humanclick.com) thing to the page, it’s an interesting idea. Kind of like combining ICQ or AIM with a referrer log. When I’m running the client on my PC, you’ll see a little icon of a guy on the side, and you can **click to talk to me**. I think it’s pretty cool.

Of course, (grumble, grumble…) the icon choices don’t really include any guys that *look* like me…
