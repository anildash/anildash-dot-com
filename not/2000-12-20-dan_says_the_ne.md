[Dan says](http://www.dansays.com/) "The New York Times ponders the future of web advertising, suggesting that traditional web banners will soon be replaced with pop-up windows, interstitials, and superstitials. Yuck."

I’ve seen many articles and essays to this effect, including [the Times article Dan referenced](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/18/technology/18STEL.html), but the first mention I heard of the idea was by Jason McCabe Calcanis, of Silicon Alley Reporter fame, who said it was [inevitable that interstitials would take over](http://www.siliconalleydaily.com/issues/sar08162000.html#Headline5706). Lo and behold, a scant 4 months later, I’m noticing pop-ups *everywhere* on the web.

So is it just me, or are there a *lot* more imposing ads being served these days?
