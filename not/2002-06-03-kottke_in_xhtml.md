Here’s a quick version (took me 45 minutes) of [kottke.org](http://www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/kottke.html) done in [valid XHTML and CSS](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A//www.dashes.com/anil/stuff/kottke.html). It’s not ideal, as there’s some weird spacing thing at the top of the page in Mozilla and the whole layout is fixed instead of liquid. But that’s [Jason](http://kottke.org/)‘s prerogative; I just wanted to show that it could be done.

I took some liberties with leaving out most of the content, just out of laziness. But there you go.
