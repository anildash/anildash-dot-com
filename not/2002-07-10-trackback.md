Whoo. I’m playing with TrackBack in [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) now. It’s great, but it’s got almost *too* much potential. I’m picturing Ben and Mena taking a brief break from their incessant bickering (it’s cute! really!) and saying, “Here’s a distributed, networked, push-enabled, server-based peer to peer metadata aggregation and microcontent syndication format with REST-based requests and XML responses! It’s blue! Try it!”
