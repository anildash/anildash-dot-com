p>Hmm… I don’t know if it falls under the **"Great minds think alike"** catchall, or if it’s merely the increasingly self-referential nature of the web, but nearly every site that’s linked to me the past few days is also *of interest* to me.

If I were a spreadsheet, I would be labeled **!Circular Reference!** or something like that, I should think.

Anyway, much thanks to Jason Kottke of [kottke.org](http://www.kottke.org), which I incidentally love the design of… ahhh, white space. Another link, and yet more "**Oooh, why didn’t *I* think of that?**" content at [Lindsay Marsh’s Weblog](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Lindsay/weblog/latest.html), she’s my current favorite across-the-pond log. (Yes, linking is equivalent to flattery on the web in the currency of "will get you everywhere".)

**Erratum**: Eeek! Revealed my ugly American-centricism by assuming Lindsay a woman. My deepest apologies

Also, upon persusal of the source for Jason’s site, I find he has a penchant for listing (in comments of course) **upcoming topics on his page**. If he’s at all like me, they’re mental notes for a future time when they will be fleshed out. Perhaps I’m pulling back the curtain on the Wizard of Oz a little bit here, but it seemed neat that this technique is **so popular** in weblogs.

Although his comments say "this is the worst use of CSS ever…I should be ashamed of myself" I would fear that my feeble attempts are deserving of that description, too.
