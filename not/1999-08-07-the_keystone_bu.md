Returned to **Pennsylvania** for the weekend to pick up some stuff (my other computer, clothes, etc.) The interesting thing is that not one, but two roadside projects there have **websites of their own**. I suppose this is that tentative first step towards a **responsive, information-rich government**. Or something like that.

The first project that caught my eye was the [Dauphin Bypass](http://www.dauphinbypass.com), which is near Interstate 81 at Harrisburg. The reason this one was striking was because the [Pennsylvania Department of Transportation](http://www.dot.state.pa.us) has actually put up **temporary road signs** (the kind that have lights spelling out the messages) which publicize the www.dauphinbypass.com address. The local paper (the Harrisburg Patriot News) had a pretty good article on people **visiting the site after reading the sign**, but they are not online (sigh), so I can’t link to it.

The most interesting feature of the Dauphin Bypass site is **email updates** which you can get by joining their mailing list. Seems like someone involved in that project really gets the web.

**Project number two** is another interesting one, this one in the heart of "downtown" Harrisburg, where, due to asbestos problems, a fire, and some other hazards, and old building for the Department of Transportation was torn down. (**[Blown up](http://www.perp.com/whale), actually**.)

On that site, they are building a new general-purpose state office called the **Keystone Building**. This project has [its own website](http://www.dgs.state.pa.us/keystone/kbhome.htm), too, with the signs around the site listing the address.

Unfortunately, I don’t know how the unsuspecting motorist driving down the street in Harrisburg is supposed to jot down the oh-so-friendly URL, which is **[http://www.dgs.state.pa.us/keystone/kbhome.htm](http://www.dgs.state.pa.us/keystone/kbhome.htm)**.

(**Note to Contractors**: Spend the extra 70 bucks and register keystonebuilding.com! Sheesh.)
