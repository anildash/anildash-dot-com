OMG I can’t believe it! I got to be on my very favorite podcast, BuzzFeed’s “[Another Round](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/another-round)“. I can verify that Tracy Clayton and Heben Nigatu are every bit as amazing in real life as they seem to be when you listen to the show.

We talked about race and identity, we talked about what we need to reform in tech, and we talked about mangoes. Basically, everything that matters. Please do give it a listen!
