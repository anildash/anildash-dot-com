Congratulations to [Andre](http://notes.torrez.org/2005/06/i_quit_my_job_o.html) for doing something fun and new and slightly risky. I’d already had a good opinion of [FMPub](http://fmpub.net/) based on John Battelle’s reputation, but with Andre on board, I’m convinced it’s going to be a success. I’m happy anytime someone takes a leap on an entrepreneurial project, but I’m also glad to see friends trying to help people make connections on the web.
