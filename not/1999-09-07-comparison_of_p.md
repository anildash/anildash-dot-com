Interesting parallels between my area of expertise and the area in which most of my clients work, or **Information Architecture vs. Spatial Architecture**. I was reading an article on **accessibility guidelines** for home construction, and it’s interesting to note how similar they are to accessibility guidelines for websites.

As excerpted from [Builder Magazine](http://www.builderonline.com)‘s (the magazine of the National Association of Home Builders) article entitled "**The Principles of Universal Design**: Seven Rules to Build By" :

**Principle 1: Equitable use.** The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities, providing the same means of use for all users without segregating or stigmatizing.

**Principle 2: Flexibility in use.** The design accomodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities, providing a choice of methods of use and adaptability to the user’s pace.

**Principle 3: Simple and intuitive use.** The design is easy to understand regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level, including effective prompting and feedback during and after the task is completed.

**Principle 4: Perceptible information.** The design communicates necessary information, using a variety of modes (visual, verbal, tactile), making it easy to give instruction or direction for proper use.

**Principle 5: Tolerance for error.** The design minimizes hazards and consequences from accidental or unintended use. Hazardous elements are eliminated, isolated, or shielded; fail-safe features and adequate warnings are provided.

**Principle 6: Low physical effort.** The design allows the user to maintain a neutral body position while minimizing repetitive action and sustained physical effort.

**Principle 7: Size and space for approach and use.** The design accomodates a variety of physical sizes, postures, and mobility, including a clear line of signt from both a seated and standing position, and all components are within reach.

**Coming tomorrow:** How these principles **relate to information** and web design.
