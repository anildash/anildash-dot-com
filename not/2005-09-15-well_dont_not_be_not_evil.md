Now, I’m as skeptical as the next person in regard to Google’s “Dont Be Evil” mantra, which makes me snicker just because , well, it seems like an awfully *low* bar to set for a company. It’s like saying my personal motto is “don’t kick kittens”. Easy!

That being said, Bill Gates’ [reaction to Google’s motto](http://news.com.com/2102-1082_3-5863514.html?tag=st.util.print) seems tone-deaf even by his near-autistic standards of interpersonal communication.

> **Gates:** Well, we don’t know everything they are up to, but we do know their slogan and we disagree with that.

Wait, *what*? You disagree with the idea of not being evil? Somebody get this guy a speaking coach!
