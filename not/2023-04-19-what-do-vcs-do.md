An increasingly large swath of culture is shaped, and even dictated, by venture capitalists, the investors who drive the agenda for much of the technology and startup world. But most people aren't that familiar with what venture capitalists actually _do_, whether that's from the perspective of a normal consumer of technology, or even as a founder or worker at a company that VCs provide (or might potentially provide) funding for.

It's worth revisiting this topic right now because, as I have noted, <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2023/02/27/tycoon-martyrdom-charade/">tech tycoons are getting increasingly radicalized</a> in their contempt for humanity and decency. An outrageous, inexcusable, brutally painful recent example is the rush by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/bob-lee-tech-reaction-san-francisco.html?searchResultPosition=1">several of the most visible venture capitalists in the industry</a> to seize upon the heartbreaking murder of entrepreneur Bob Lee as an excuse to target the vulnerable and pin the blame on the unhoused and those living with mental illness.

It's important to understand: the most powerful and influential venture capitalists in the industry will unapologetically use your death for their own gain, as Jason Calacanis has done in <em>literally running for mayor</em> on the basis of Bob's murder. And that's with Bob being an extraordinarly successful entrepreneur — co-creator of CashApp, having earned the appreciation of millions of users and enabled the creation of billions of dollars in value. That's the <em>best case scenario</em> and even in death, Bob was not a person, he was just a tool to be used by these folks. And this is what they do to a person they call a _friend_.

I used to think people like Matt Ocko were among the more reasonable and thoughtful VCs. Now, he uses a lie to exploit Bob's death to place blame for the murder on... a guy who is no longer in office due to a recall Ocko and his compatriots funded.

## Middlemen for Money

More structually, venture capitalists are responsible for managing the high-risk, high-return subset of the financial portfolios of the world's wealthiest people and organizations. In theory, the way it works is some mega-billionaire (or a retirement fund that's trying to guarantee a certain amount of money returned over time) has a balanced portfolio of different kinds of investments. Most of them are relatively conservative and have a smaller return, and then there's supposed to be one smaller segment of higher-risk investment that may have a larger return over time. That segment is what VCs are supposed to be helping find, in exchange for those big funders providing their money.

This is a key fact that so many in the tech industry don't understand — VCs are the middle-men for the money of _their_ investors, who are called "limited partners" or LPs. LPs provide the vast majority of the money that make all the startups go, and the VCs just decide where to point the money cannon. A handful of VCs do this in a thoughtful and ethical way, although that's increasingly an anachronism, or a side novelty (like the firms that specialize in investing in underrepresented founders), but the venture capital industry is going through a hyper-concentration of power and wealth into an increasingly small number of mega-firms, just like all the industries that they've tried to reshape.

Importantly, LPs can, and often do, invest in multiple venture capital firms. VCs are _far_ more concerned with keeping their LPs happy than they are with keeping any individual founder or startup happy. In particular, they're very often focused on trying to convince the LP to invest in their _next_ fund.

Another key fact about VCs that most people who have not interacted with them don't understand is that they all talk to each other, all the time, and compare notes. That can be about the best strategy for hitting up LPs for money (though that's a little more fraught since they're competing with each other for those funds) but it _definitely_ happens when VCs are comparing notes about the companies they might potentially fund. If you have an interesting startup, they'll be texting with other VCs about your company as soon as you walk out of the meeting where you gave them your pitch.

Within the VC industry, partners routinely move between the major firms, especially earlier in their careers when they're building relationships. So you have people who get their money from the same few giant sources of money, regularly work with each other either in the same company or across different companies, and compare notes with each other on a near-daily basis. Then _after_ they invest in a company, they serve on the board of that company alongside the other VCs that they've been talking to.

In short, most of the VCs at the major firms that control the industry agenda are better understood as a cohort of colleagues and coworkers who happen to sit in different offices. This comparison gets even more pronounced when we consider information rights, the permission that investors have to know about the financial and operational details of a company. VCs will demand a look into these details when they're considering funding a company, and will often retain rights to that highly-sensitive company information after they've decided to offer money to fund it. This means VCs will have a deep look into the business and market fundamentals for your company, but also likely your competitors' companies as well, which gives them a more complete picture of a market than those who are actually working at the startups in that market.

And then keep in mind, all the VCs with these information rights are talking to each other. Though there are ostensibly regulatory or ethical boundaries that keep them from sharing this information, keep in mind that many of the people with this information are people who will literally use the murder of a founder to advance their political ambitions. They're not concerned with whether or not it's polite to talk about your bank balance.

What do you have when an entire class of investors all work together to assemble an unfair amount of insider information in order to assemble an advantaged position against the entrepreneurs who are supposed to be coming to them for investment? It's a racket. Maybe it's a consortium at best, but it's open collusion in actual practice.

This reality is even more extraordinary when we consider that the regulatory framework under which these firms operate treats venture capital firms as if they were _competitors_ in a market with winners and losers. This is very obviously not the case — it's not zero-sum, and VCs will openly talk about "leaving room on the cap[italization] table" for other VCs to join them. Anybody who you save space for at the table is not a competitor who's trying to destroy you, they're a partner you're trying to take care of.

The radicalization of the VC class becomes extremely easy to understand in this context. Even the good, decent, thoughtful venture capitalists I know will invest in companies alongside openly fascist VCs, because if they didn't, they wouldn't be able to function in the industry. One justification is "well, that way it's not just bad guys around the table in the board room", though we can all see how well that works. Another justification is more pragmatic, "I've got to do some deals, and if I didn't do deals alongside these guys, there wouldn't be any left". This argument is at least intellectually honest.

It would be career suicide for one of the non-fascist VCs to publicly refuse to do business alongside the openly destructive VCs. So, the downward slide continues unabated.

## Fake Markets and the end of competition

- Turning everything into a fake market in order to remove the risk
 - https://www.anildash.com/2017/03/01/tech_and_the_fake_market_tactic/
- Make money even if the company doesn't, or never could
- Things like AI are funded because they are extractive tools of wealth concentration — that's why they train on artists and writers and coders, not on VCs
- The simple goal is to undermine the power that workers get, like coders being the highest paid and most powerful workers in the history of labor, and writers and artists having outsized cultural influence, with values that directly contradict the values of investors.

## What we can do

I'm fortunate; I have the credibility of having been in the tech industry for decades, having raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and having earned the trust of the last era of credible investors — some of whom I connected to founders who eventually ended up making them millions of dollars.

As a result, it's hard to just dismiss me out of hand. But in my conversations about this pattern with journalists, academics, and regulators, there's a huge degree of skepticism about the very obvious reality that the venture capital industry is not a competitive market, and that this has resulted in both political radicalization and anticompetitive exploitation of the rest of the ecosystem. A lot of the reticence is attributable not to any factual disagreement, but just the intimidating reality of how difficult it will be to reckon with this systemic breakdown.
