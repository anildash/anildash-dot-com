Paul Scrivens has been doing a great job of leveraging his brash personality and formidable talent to make a name for himself, especially in the design world. And he did a hell of a job at the [kickball game](http://www.dashes.com/kick/) this year, too. So I’m glad to see Scrivs focusing his energies on an idea like his new [Ignoring the Hype Series](http://9rules.com/whitespace/ignoring_the_hype_series.php).

In it, Paul’s looking at sites that he feels are overhyped, and pointing out ways that we can all improve. Now, I’ve tried to push back against unwarranted hype myself, but I think the bigger point that Paul makes is that we do need good, well-reasoned criticism of the tools and technologies that are being delivered today. What I see right now is either breathless praise or “This sucks!” and very little detailed look at how the applications and services we use could be evolving. I’m hoping this starts a trend in that direction.
