Just found an interesting program called [PHPCompiler](http://www.deskcode.com/phpcompiler/) that purports to make Windows executables out of PHP code. Or, more accurately, itâ€™s a bunch of support DLLs that allow your code to be parsed at runtime.

Hmm. Also, has anyone ported the Zend engine to be a Windows Scripting Host engine? Go do that, somebody.
