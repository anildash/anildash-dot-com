…and you put links in your browser, and that’s what makes the web work.

- Last October, *Reason* published an [interesting look at bloggers’ overreactions](http://www.reason.com/cy/cy102505.shtml) and even downright misrepresentations of an attack at the University of Oklahoma.
- Michael Fitzgerald has a [nice piece in CIO](http://cio.idg.com.au/pp.php?id=1756744558&amp;pp=1&amp;fp=16&amp;fpid=0) about starting a business blog. I’m in there, briefly, but it’s worth reading anyway.
- Prince is going to play halftime at the next Superbowl. [Farkers (surprisingly!) rejoice](http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=218792).
- FAQs and Walkthroughs for [New Super Mario Bros](http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/game/920787.html). I’ve got three stars, I’ve done Challenge Mode… now I’m just wandering around looking for things to do.
- [Data structures as culture](http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2004/12/25/data-structures-as-culture/). I *love* this stuff: “Microsoft emphasizes tree problems because their culture puts a high value on the kind of mental gymnastics often necessary to solve such problems, while Apple emphasizes hashtables because its aesthetically-oriented culture prizes their combination of zen-like simplicity and seemingly impossible speed.”
- The Chicago Tribune published [a list of the 50 best magazines](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0606140373jun15,1,4243630.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true) a while ago. I *love* magazines, so I have nothing but objections to this list, but I’d say that [Baseline](http://www.baselinemag.com/) is a glaring omission.
- Are [The Oaktree and The Bird the same dance](http://creamsnake.livejournal.com/43864.html?view=101720)? Could be! If only Morris had someone to hold up a mirror to his dancing, so he could judge.
