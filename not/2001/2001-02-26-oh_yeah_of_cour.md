Oh yeah, of course [Dan](http://www.lakefx.nu), the King of Trivia, dug up the [photo of Mir](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/archives/sts-91/images/postflight/lores/91727051.jpg) I was babbling about earlier. He protests that Mir really only looks bad on the inside, but Iâ€™m pretty sure I can see duct tape on this photo.
