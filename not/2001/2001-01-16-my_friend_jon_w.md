My friend Jon, who doesn’t have a blog, but probably should, emailed me this [PDF file recounting a little history of the Lomax recordings](stuff/lomax.pdf), in response to the [comments I made a few weeks ago](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2000_12_01_archive.php#1737368) regarding the genesis of some of Moby’s samples for *Play*.

Turns out father and son Lomax might have been a bit more exploitative than their reputations would indicate…
