Part of the reason I like keeping in touch with [George](http://www.allaboutgeorge.com) is because he’s got my back on all my **crazy pop-culture theories**. Like seeing allusions to [Flannery O’Connor’s](http://library.gcsu.edu/~sc/foc.html)*The River* in [Janet Jackson’s latest video](http://www.launch.com/musicvideos/view/not_start/1,,1079919~1057,00.html), or pick up on the fact that I would imagine [MemePusher](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_07_01_archive.php#4773105)‘s name to be a subtle [Curtis Mayfield](http://curtismayfield.cjb.net/) tribute.

Or, maybe we’re both just nuts.
