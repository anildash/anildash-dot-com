[Microsoft Portrait](http://research.microsoft.com/~jiangli/portrait/) is a black-and-white low bandwidth videoconferencing application, courtesy of Microsoft’s research labs in China. In motion, it’s eerily reminiscent of footage from a [Fisher Price PXL-2000](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pxl2000/).

My webcam was lost when I moved to my new apartment, so until it’s found I can’t really do a thorough test, but I think running video to my Pocket PC across my wireless 802.11b network with this thing should give me more than enough geek cred to get through the holidays.
