Sigh. I’m such a loser geek. In addition to going around compulsively micropaying everybody or buying stuff off their Amazon WishLists, I’ve got to go blow $100 on [another pathetic habit of mine](http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439259/20010209/prince.jhtml). I’ve compensated for the loss of my job by increasing expenses commensurately.
