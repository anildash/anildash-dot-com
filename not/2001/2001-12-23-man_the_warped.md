Man, the [Warped Toys List](http://www.gracehartford.org/warped_toys_2001_list.htm) rocks! If it weren’t for Grace Church’s efforts, I’d never have been able to add the Resident Evil 2 [William Birkin and Sherry Playset](http://www.sonic.net/~raiden/figs/william_sherry_f.jpg) to my wishlist. Just listen to this ringing endorsement: “This violently interactive toy borders on promoting incest, leaving that as a clear impression on children in testing.”

Ho Ho Ho!
