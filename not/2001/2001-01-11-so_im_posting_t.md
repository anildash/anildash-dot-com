So I’m posting this in [Mozilla 0.7](http://www.mozilla.org), which is the first stable version that’s even remotely possible to use as a primary browser. Although I have to admit that Blogger looks ugly as shit, as so does every skin I can find for this thing.

Seems like the browser they should have released about 3 years ago…
