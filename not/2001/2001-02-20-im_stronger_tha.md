I’m stronger than yesterday. My loneliness ain’t killing me no more. I’m serious here. No irony, no mocking. Nothing against sarcasm, it’s one of my best friends. I just really like this Britney Spears song. Not in a "Ha ha, I’m so *clever*" way, but just because it’s one of the kinds of music I like. Why won’t anyone believe this?

In fact, if I were being totally honest, I would go beyond confessing that I quite enjoy the video and I would admit that, under the right circumstances, I might find the song motivational. Hell, inspirational even. Because good pop music is like that. Makes me wish I had a car to speed around in unsafely while listening to good pop music at extremely loud volume.

Here, go watch [the video](http://www.getmusic.com/peeps/britney/media.html). Or just [download the song](nap:search?artist=britney+stronger). Enjoy!
