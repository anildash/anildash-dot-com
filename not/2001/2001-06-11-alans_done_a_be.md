Alan’s done a beautiful thing with [300 Miles High](http://www.kokogiak.com/300miles/). It’s a collection of photos of Earth, taken from space. But the wodnerful part is that the photos are chosen with an emphasis on aesthetics, instead of science.

Contrasts nicely with [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html), and when you see the pictures he’s chosen, they can be astoundingly moving, if you’re in the right mood. Reminds us what a new perspective can do.
