I don’t know, I tend to agree with everything [Jason](http://q.queso.com/2001/02/12) says just on principle because he’s cool. But first, he didn’t know about NetCell? And today he disses the XFL even though this past weekend’s game was the first interesting football game I’ve seen on TV in ages?

I’m gonna have to rethink my slavish adulation now… heh heh heh
