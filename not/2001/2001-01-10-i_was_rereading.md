I was re-reading [Dan’s manifestito](http://www.lakefx.nu/manifestito.html) today, and I realize that, somewhat deliberately, **I’ve never talked about *why* I have this site**, or why I update it almost every day. I still don’t know if I should explain that, or if anyone even cares if I do. But that’s my name up there, so I guess I can do whatever the hell I want…

I guess I could start by saying that most of Dan’s rant applies to me as well. That’s probably why he and I link to each other fairly often, similar thoughts. I started running this weblog back around the time that ["weblog" was first being shortened to "blog"](http://www.peterme.com/browsed/browsed060999.html), but I’ve never been very interested in the form so much as the function. I’m a pretty extroverted guy when in public, but **I’m probably never happier than when I’m reading about something new I don’t know about**. The only way to "meet" someone *while* browsing the web from the comfort of my little apartment has been the blogging community.

And that’s cool; Meeting fellow bloggers must be a pretty appealing concept to me if it can get me to go visit [Texas](http://www.sxsw.com) in a couple of weeks. But that’s more of a *result* than a motivation. So why then? Well, because I like having a little place where I can put my thoughts and rants and, yes, [peeves](index.php?peeves.php). Last week, thanks to [Wired](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,40979,00.html), somewhere around 5,000 people read my Peeves page alone. But I don’t expect them to care about what is bugging me on a day-to-day basis.

However, I *do* think that a consistent peek into someone’s thoughts, the parts of themselves that they choose to reveal in this sort of forum, does a remarkable job of helping to find similar minds. **And that’s pretty valuable.** I find it a lot more fun and effective to learn from people with similar minds to my own, and I like that this medium of the web that I spend so much time working on, and apologizing for, and talking about, and arguing over, can give me something back by giving me a little digital coaster for the times when my brain spills over.

And best of all, sometimes [you people email me](mailto:anil@dashes.com). Maybe because it feeds my unattractively large ego, but hearing from people is incredibly satisfying: Positive feedback for me, on thoughts and writings that I would probably have been doing anyway. **So affirming, no wonder it’s addictive.**

And oh, should I add an "about" section?
