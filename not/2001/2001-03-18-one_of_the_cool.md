One of the coolest people I met in Texas was [Andre](http://torrez.org/). He’s got a remarkably dry and witty sense of humor, and it was really, really entertaining to watch things with him. I think I would have driven out with him if I had been coming from the same ocean he started at.

I didn’t know he was 28 until we were talking about it on my last night in Austin. He should have put that on FilePile somewhere, because then I woulda noticed.
