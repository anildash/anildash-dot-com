Sometimes people ask me why I felt out of place sometimes growing up in Pennsylvania, or why I always knew I wanted to end up in New York City. Perhaps a picture *is* worth a thousand words, as the picture below was taken at a **wedding reception** that I once attended in Pennsylvania, near where I grew up.
