[Steven Den Beste](http://www.metafilter.com/user.mefi/522) has posted **258 links** to MetaFilter in the less than one year he’s been on the site. I’ve been a member 3 days longer, though I had read the site for months before that, and I’ve posted 6 links.

I don’t mean to pick on him, as he has posted some links that yielded good discussions. But I think he’s kinda using MeFi as his personal blog. When it’s [so easy](http://www.blogspot.com) to get a blog of your own, and even easier when you [already have a site](http://home.san.rr.com/denbeste/), I think there comes a point when someone ought to be the bad guy, like I’m being right now, and just call a guy out.

This is all prompted by [today’s *21* threads](http://www.metafilter.com), and the danger that the massive overposting poses to one of my very favorite sites. I don’t share [some people](http://www.kottke.org)‘s distaste for Salon links or general news stories; I just care if a link prompts good discussion. I also like for as many different voices as possible to participate, and I think that the frequency (and, let it not be ignored, reader interest) in Steven’s posts means it’s time for him to get a blog of his own.

If I’ve offended Steven, I’m sorry. I didn’t email this to him because I don’t think anyone wants a message like this, that could be potentially offensive, in their email. If he wants to come to my site and read my opinion, he’s welcome. I like a lot of his links, (I don’t get over to HardOCP often enough to see the cool shit that he finds there) but I have more of a passion for the kind of community MetaFilter has, and I think there’s an easy solution to preserving both. That’s my goal.

And I know I’m not the MeFi cop. That’s why this is on *my* site, with *my* name up there at the top. If this annoys you or pisses you off, I’d suggest you get a [peeves page](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?peeves.php) of your own and put me on it. So there.

**Addendum:** Apparently, I’m not the only one who feels this way. There’s an [entire thread on MetaTalk](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/metadetail.mefi/300) about this subject. Including the quote I was looking for where Steven says he doesn’t have enough material for a blog. Tish-posh, I say. Go read what everyone else said.
