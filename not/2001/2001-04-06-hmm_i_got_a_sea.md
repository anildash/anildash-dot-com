Hmm… I got a search report for what people searched for on my site last month. I tend to check those out when they come in because they’re infrequent and a lot more interesting than the server logs that I guess I’m supposed to be obsessing over. So last month someone was rooting around my site and searched on the following list of terms:

- love
- photo
- picture of me
- age
- brother
- dad
- drug abuse
- family photo
- girlfriend
- marriage
- married

Now, I’m assuming that it’s probably one of the prospective employers I’ve been applying and interviewing with, but what seems peculiar to me is that they wouldn’t just *email* me to ask about these things. I realize there are legal ramifications to a lot of these questions that preclude a formal inquiry into any of this in an interview situation. But I’m sure anyone clever enough to get to my site would figure a way to obliquely find this info out.

Maybe I haven’t made the link prominent enough, but you can [email me](mailto:anil@dashes.com), you know.
