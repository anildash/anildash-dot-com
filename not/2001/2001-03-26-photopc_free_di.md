The download software that came with my digital camera (an old Olympus 340R) is so miserable that I went looking for replacements. I found [PhotoPC](http://www.lightner.net/lightner/bruce/photopc/), which is an open source version of the download software written to work with this model and a host of others with similar internals. The supported cameras are from Epson, Agfa, Sanyo, Nikon, and Toshiba, in addition to the Olympus ones.

It’s some ugly command-line stuff, but it can’t be any worse than the crap Olympus ships. And, from what I’ve heard, there’s no way to get the Olympus software again if you lose your original CD. Morons.
