Man, reading about the [Microsoft Office XP Smart Tag SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/code/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/562/msdncompositedoc.xml) makes me wish DeepLeap was still around… sigh. There’s also a [press release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2001/Feb01/02-21SDKpr.asp) with more info on Smart Tags.
