I have used these for ages; They’re one of the first things I install on a development machine. But I don’t remember if I’ve mentioned them here before: The [Web Design Group WiDGets for IE](http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/widgets/#nostyle). The page still lists a vestigial version number of IE4, but they work just fine with Internet Explorer 5 and 6. Included are such magical gadgets as a right-click menu that [removes style sheets from a page](http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/widgets/#nostyle), which is invaluable if you’re making one of those new super-compliant pages that are all the rage with the kids these days.

On a semi-related note, one of the sublime pleasures afforded as a side-effect of [Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com)‘s [Great Leap Forward](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/tohell/) is that now all the CSS-positioned pages do this magical transformation during the delay from the load of the HTML to the load of the CSS file. I can’t imagine what it’s like on a dial-up connection, but on my reasonably high-performance machine like mine and a sooopa-fast cable modem, it’s pure magic. **Pop!** And all of a sudden a plain black and white text-only page is all lined up and awash in color. Go ahead and try it, Dan’s [Big (Blue and) Green Monster](http://www.lakefx.nu) is a good place to start.
