While Iâ€™m being an art appreciator, please to be seeing [Manhattan Timeformations](http://www.skyscraper.org/timeformations/intro.html), a visual history of my city, all in Flash. I love the history of Manhattan. I love visual displays of rich information. I love good web content.

I need a few minutes alone with this site. There may very well be no site more closely suited to my tastes on the entire Internet.
