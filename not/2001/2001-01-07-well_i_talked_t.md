Well, I talked to [Mike](http://home.inreach.com/mdunn/), who made the Hard Links program I was talking about below, and while I was a little off about his program, (it makes hard links to files, not junctions to folders) it was still a really cool, useful program and he graciously let me host it here. So, feel free to [download it](__GHOST_URL__/tools/hardlink.zip). That file gives you a .dll that will add the context menu for you.

And while we’re getting really techie, you’ll need to register that .dll once it’s downloaded, [here’s a registry tweak](__GHOST_URL__/tools/dllregisters.zip) that’ll let you register those DLL’s by right-clicking.
