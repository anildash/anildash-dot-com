So I’ve been reading what [Brig](http://www.eatonweb.com) and [Ariana](http://www.nubbin.com/) have written over the past few weeks, and I’m struck because they seem to be pondering the same question as me: **Is there still room in the web business for a generalist?**

See, I’m a little bit good at a bunch of different web things, and now I want to apply those skills as a consultant. But I fear that the wild world of the web is too broad now for one person to sell their services as a Jack/Jill of all trades…

I guess I’ve gotta figure out a way to get paid for being really, really good at surfing the web.
