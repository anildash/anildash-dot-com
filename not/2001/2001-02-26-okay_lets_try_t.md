Okay, let’s try that again… [Peter](http://www.peterme.com/) has semi-announced the company that he and a few others are working on. It looks like a great team, and I wish them all the best. Starting a company is quite a lot of really hard, fun work.

And also, I’m sucking up to them so that I get some scraps of business from the dev work that’s coincident to their areas of expertise. The interesting thing is that the structure they’ve apparently come up with parallels many of the ideas I had about a web design/development firm, which would seem to be a natural complement to an interaction design/user experience firm…
