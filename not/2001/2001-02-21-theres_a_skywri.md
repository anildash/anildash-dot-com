There’s a skywriting airplane going around up in the sky outside my apartment. Only instead of writing "Will you marry me, Ishamel?" or "Eat at Joe’s!" the pilot is drawing… clouds. It’s surreal, definitely something I’d associate more with you Left Coast types.

On an unrelated note, I have created a new recipe for you to file away in that box of index cards in the kitchen:

> **Jello X-Treme:**
> 
> Prepare Jello according to box instructions, but use half the amount of water.
> 
> Serves one glutton.

Perhaps I was wrong about Tang as an ingredient…
