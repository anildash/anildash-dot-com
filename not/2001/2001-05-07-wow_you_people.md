Wow, you people are the best. I take back all the nasty things I said. Since my [pathetic little whining](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_05_01_archive.php#3499740) about Amazon trusted friends went up the day before yesterday, I’ve had all kind of people add me to their lists. Just to list the ones whose sites I know, [Kristin](http://www.booboolina.com/), [Thomas](http://www.vanderwal.net/random/index.html), [Christina](http://eleganthack.com/), [Matt](http://www.hit-or-miss.org) and [Mena](http://www.dollarshort.org/) all added me as a trusted friend.

The unfortunate part is that my Amazon browsing doesn’t reflect my tastes very well, as it’s a really small sampling and tends towards the obvious things that I remember I want. But the lesson I’ve taken home from all of this? **I should resort to pathetic self-pitying more often.**
