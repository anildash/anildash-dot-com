Lane makes a [pretty persuasive argument](http://www.monstro.com/past/2001_06_01_index.shtml#4304214) that I’ve allowed Microsoft to frame the argument in my discussion of Smart Tags. I would prefer to think that I was just ignoring the greater issue of debate that he’s discussing, but maybe he’s right. Go take a look-see.
