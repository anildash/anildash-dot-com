If you’ve got a website, you’re probably familiar with the [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com) tools. Edit the way they work with your site with the [Related Links Editor](http://editorial2.alexa.com/rl_editor.cgi), the [Indexing Request Form](http://www.alexa.com/help/webmasters/request_bot.html), and the [Site Information Editor](http://editorial2.alexa.com/site_editor.cgi).

I was proud for years that I was a Related Link for [Tomalak’s Realm](http://www.tomalak.org), not that it got me much traffic. But I’m checking now and apparently I’m not related anymore. Alas.
