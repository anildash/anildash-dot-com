I only know how to crudely wave my pencil or slap at the keyboard to describe the world I live in. It’s a source of constant frustration and inspiration to me that I can read something like [Paul Ford’s writing](http://ftrain.com/cleaning_the_room.html) and have my world reflected back to me more accurately and eloquently than my own fumbling can achieve.
