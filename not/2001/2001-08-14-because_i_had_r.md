Because I had run into him again on Friday and was still struck by what a nice fella he is, go look at [David Gallagher’s Lightning Field](http://lightningfield.com/). And, hey, whadaya know…? It’s a [Blog of Note](http://www.blogger.com).

Also residing in NiceFellaLand is [MarkAnd](http://www.markand.com/)erson, whose generosity knows no bounds. In fact, my nascent DVD collection can attest to the man’s generosity. But don’t just [steal his books](http://www.markand.com/lend.html), people. Show him love.

Speaking of books, [Chason](http://chason.nulldesign.com/) needs a good one. The topic? Cognitive Science. He’s looking for a good intro book. I’m hoping one of you Genuinely Smart People can help him.

And, while I’m sharing linky-love, her return has confirmed that I *still* have a little, illustrated crush on the lines-and-ink Claire in [Claire](http://www.loobylu.com/)‘s drawings.
