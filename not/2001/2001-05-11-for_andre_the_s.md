For [Andre](http://www.torrez.org), the [Show Robots.txt](javascript:void(location.href='http://'%20+%20location.host%20+%20'/robots.txt')) [bookmarklet](http://www.bookmarklets.com). As Andre correctly pointed out to me, it’s a wonderful thing that we live in a world where we have to write little notes to robots that crawl around the Internet.

Stay out, Robot! Go here, Robot! Good Robot. (What’s a [robots.txt](http://www.internet-tips.net/Advertising/robots.htm) file?)
