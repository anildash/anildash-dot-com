I’ve probably offended more people in the past 2 days during all sorts of random conversations than I had in the entire 2 years prior. I tend to speak my mind a lot, and with strong opinions, but I’d always thought I was good at tempering my thoughts with enough tact and manners that they wouldn’t cause too much offense. I fear that my recent re-emergence from my hermitlike existence of the last few years has revealed that my skills at reading people and censoring myself have atrophied more than I suspected.

Which means, time for me to shut up a bit. I still have so much more to learn. But I’m trying, I swear.
