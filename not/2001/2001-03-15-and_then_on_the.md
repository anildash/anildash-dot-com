And then on the Ides of March in 1991, we graduated from [index cards](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_01_01_archive.php#2055340) to multi-page missives. I think the first one was seven pages, notebook-sized, front and back. The only thing that could follow was me falling head over heels.
