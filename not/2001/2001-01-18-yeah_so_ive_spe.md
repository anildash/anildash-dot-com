Yeah, so I’ve spent lots of time on the World Wide Web. But until today, I had never visited [The Schumin Web](http://www.schuminweb.com/).

Please, go there. Don’t waste your time here– experience what The Schumin Web has to offer. Suggested highlights: [Ben’s blank verse](http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/writings/high-school/love-for-wrong-reasons.htm), the [site updates](http://www.schuminweb.com/schumin-web/archives/site-updates.htm), and of course the [PowerPoint Overview of *The Schumin Web*](http://members.nbci.com/bschumin/schumin-web/schumin-web.ppt).

Insightful analysis of The Schumin Web can be found [here](http://www.spinnwebe.com/stories/schumin/index.html). Don’t say I didn’t warn you…
