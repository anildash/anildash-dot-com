Somehow, the [International Atomic Energy Agency](http://www.iaea.org/) keeps showing up as a referrer to this site. Now, I’m used to weird things popping up now and then, usually due to a browser mishandling a request and listing a visitor’s last site as having directed them to this one.

But I don’t look at my logs very often, and every time I do, that name is in there again. What the hell is going on? Explain this to me!
