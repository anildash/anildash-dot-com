Just another reason [Dan Bricklin](http://danbricklin.com/log/)â€˜s a great role model for the tech industry, his ability to take valuable lessons from unlikely places. Case in point, his current analysis of *Crouching Tiger*, where he discovers a **strongly pro-education subtext** to the film.

Which seems a much more likely and credible message for the film than, say, some [*other* interpretations](http://www.harrumph.com/010122.html).
