So, lots of updates to my [portal](http://www.dashes.com/portal/), which is still a lousy representation of my real surfing patterns, despite the addition of the [Google Zeitgeist](http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html) and [NY Times Most Popular](http://ea.nytimes.com/cgi-bin/poppage), because a lot of the other links on there are old or dead or boring.

If I get super-motivated, maybe a revamp to that page coming soon.
