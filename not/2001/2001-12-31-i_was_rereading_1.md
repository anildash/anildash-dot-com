I was re-reading an email I had sent to a friend who had emailed me on my birthday, in the first week of September. In my reply, I had said “After [personal relationship trouble] and being jobless for half a year and all the other stuff in the past year or so, as long as the rest of 2001 proceeds without anything majorly stressful, I think I’m gonna be just fine.”

In addition to my chagrin at the fact that I apparently learned the use of adjectives from a Valley Girl, I am amazed at just how much we’ve all been able to get through these past few months. While it shows that we’re stronger than we may think, let’s keep our fingers crossed that none of us are ever so tested again. I hope that 2002 is as blissful and peaceful as we all deserve.

Happy New Year.
