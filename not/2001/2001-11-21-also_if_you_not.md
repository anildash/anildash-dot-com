Also, if you note the link on the sidebar, you’ll see that I’ll be participating in [Link and Think](http://www.linkandthink.org/), which is the newly rechristened observance formerly known as Day With(out) Weblogs. I’ve proudly participated in this event since its inception, and since December 1 will be dedicated to thinking about all of us who are affected by the pandemic, I want to make sure *before* December 1st that everyone knows just how much love and effort my good friend [Brad Graham](http://www.bradlands.com) puts into this project every year.

All this and he’s cute, too!
