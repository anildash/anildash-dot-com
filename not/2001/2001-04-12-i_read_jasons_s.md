I read [Jason](http://q.queso.com)‘s site every day. But today, he just *blew me away* with his recounting of his [Incredible Day](http://q.queso.com/incredibleDay). It’s moving, and true, and amazing, and… well, I think I said it all a little better over at [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/comments.mefi/6970#68414).
