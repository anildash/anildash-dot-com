[Brig](http://www.eatonweb.com) pointed out [The new Slackers](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/02/26/new_slackers/index.html), and I too can relate to it. But what always bums me out is that the Slacker label, which appears to have reared its ugly head again, was never retracted when all of us Slackers made this exciting new medium. Or when we helped all the old money get even richer off of it.

Ingrates.
