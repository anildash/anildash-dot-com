[Ev gets some crap](http://www.evhead.com/archives/2001_07_01_arch.asp#4817057) about [IsDickCheneyDeadYet.com](http://isdickcheneydeadyet.com/), which serves him right, since he stole my IDCDY link for [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)‘s “Blogs of Note”. Along with [Four Stones](http://www.fourstones.net/blog/), [Turbanhead](http://www.geocities.com/radarmary/main.html), and another one I can’t remember right now.
