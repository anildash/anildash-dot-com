Today is the first of what I hope to be several Embarrassing Confession Days here at dashes.com. What’s today’s Embarrassing Confession? **I like date movies.** Crappy, formulaic, sappy, predictable cheesy date movies. It’s taken me several years to come out about this, and really accept and acknowledge it, but it’s true.

It started years ago, when I would acknowledge films that were either minor in the genre of Date Movies, or that were only tangentially related. I would freely admit to liking "[Chasing Amy](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118842)" but that was okay because it was Kevin Smith and they don’t really end up happily ever after, and so that’s safe to like, right?

And a few years before that, I really enjoyed "[Boomerang](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103859)," but I made excuses… I mean, hell, this one has *Halle Berry* in it, and so it didn’t really count, right?

But I could no longer deny my inherent pathetically romantic nature as the years went by. (Brace yourself here…) Yes, [You’ve Got Mail](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0128853) came out, and not only did I go to see it, *in the theater*, but I went willingly. And I enjoyed it. **A movie about AOL.**

Sigh.

So, by now, I knew there was a problem. This was the lowest of the low. One of the very lowest of the barrel-scraping formula films in a despicable genre. It had it all: Nora Ephron, Meg Ryan, mistaken identity, Manhattan… I could sink no lower. Was it only a matter of time until I hit rock bottom? What next, "Sleepless in Seattle"? *Jerry* Fucking *Maguire*?

So I knew I had a problem to face, and I dealt with it. I went to see "Gladiator" this year, and loved it. Yeah! But for every fight scene I saw, there was still a balancing romantic factor. I saw the very battle for my cinematic, aesthetic soul played out in "Crouching Tiger"… Here was fight scenes, intercut with incomprehensible, flashback-filled, soft-focus romance. Which side would I choose?

It’s times like this when I understand how people start to drink. I don’t know that I will ever reconcile the two sides of my nature, the dark and the light. You know, the whole Yin-Yang thing. One thing’s for certain, though. If I had a date, I’d want to see "[Someone Like You](http://someonelikeyoumovie.com/)". But not just because of Ashley Judd. It’s because [Wolverine](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Jackman,+Hugh) is in it. Honest.
