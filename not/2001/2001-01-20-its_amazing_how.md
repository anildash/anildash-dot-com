It’s amazing how well-timed words, or advice given at the right time, or the presentation of a idea, can make the simplest sentence stay with a person. Almost exactly ten years ago a friend of mine in high school casually gave me a quote, written on an index card, in the middle of a class that I’m sure I probably was supposed to have been paying attention to.

The friend, the card, the class… none of those are in my life anymore. I’m sure they were all gone within a few months. But the quote popped up fully-formed in my brain just now, simply from having heard a sentence with a similar structure.

> “The miracle is this … the more we share, the more we have.”
> 
> Leonard Nimoy

I don’t know why that’s stuck in my head.
