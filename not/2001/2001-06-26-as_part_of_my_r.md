As part of my recurring effort (no, not really, I’ve never done this before…) to show you the back stories of webloggers who have linked to me, I have dug up some cool net history. Today’s victim is [Ed Vielmetti](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~emv/project/vacuum/weblog.html), whom you can see helping to form the modern web during his participation in [a mailing list discussion](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1992NovDec/0213.html) with [Lou Montulli](http://www.montulli.org/lou/) and [Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/).

In these few linked messages, these fellows, along with a few others, laid out the foundations for the form-handling functions in the first web browsers, which we all rely on today for much of the basic functionality that we take for granted. Without this, no Amazon, no Blogger, no search box on Yahoo or Google. Amazing!

Know any other real-life web heroes? [Tell me about it](javascript:viewComments(4259876)). ( echo commentCount(4259876); ?>)
