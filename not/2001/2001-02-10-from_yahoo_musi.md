From [Yahoo! Music](http://urban.yahoo.com/urban/music_news/wall_of_sound/story.html?s=n/wall_of_sound/urban/news/20010209/20010209002):

> Techno whiz Moby is holed up in his Manhattan, N.Y., apartment, teaching himself Pro-Tools and “obsessively writing stuff for the next album.” As for its sound, he says on his Web site that he just bought $200 worth of old, romantic soul CDs at his local Tower Records � the same place he discovered the archival gospel recordings that helped shape the sound of Play.

Hey, that’s the same thing *I’m* doing right now. Except I already had the soul records. I guess Yahoo should do a story on me. On a related note, does anybody know how to hack the ProTools Free installer so that it installs on Windows 2000? There’s no reason it shouldn’t, but of course it doesn’t…
