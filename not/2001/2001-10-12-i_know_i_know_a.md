I know, I know. A month gone by. And still, that fucking smell everywhere. It’s like my own telltale heart, it’s a damned spot what won’t out. I’ve always thought there is no situation so dire that Stevie Wonder can’t help, and while I still believe this to be true, I suspect I’m not the only one who’s had his faith in something tested in the past month.
