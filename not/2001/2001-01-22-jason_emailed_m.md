Jason emailed me about a bunch of [Yahoo history links](http://www.kottke.org/notes/0101.html#010121) that he just added, and some of these are really great. I guess I am as guilty of the tendency for instant nostalgia that the web seems to bring out in everyone. I think he includes all the links that [I found before](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2000_12_01_archive.php#1812934).
