Joost is a Michael Jackson fan. He has a fan site called [The Livinâ€™ Legend](http://michael-jackson.webjump.com). One day, Joost and his friends decided that they were such big fans that they would **put on blackface and dress up as the Jackson 5, and then *perform in public***.

Most importantly, [Joost took photos](http://michael-jackson.webjump.com/reunion/fotos.htm).
