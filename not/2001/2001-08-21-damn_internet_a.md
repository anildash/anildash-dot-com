Damn Internet anonymity! Who was the kind soul who sent me the Strunk & White book? I *hate* not knowing who sends me a gift! But thank you, thank you, thank you!

[Heather](http://www.harrumph.com) is the best person ever. But then again, you already knew that. And I am quite glad she is not really blonde, that would have been unfortunate.
