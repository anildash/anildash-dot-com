After seeing [this request for contributors](http://www.blogger.com/discuss/d.pyra?t=702062&amp;c=700036), I checked out [Today on the Subway](http://gus.protest.net/subway/subway.html), which may grow into a natural sister site to the upcoming [New York Stories](http://nystories.net/) site. Which is, of course, part of [Derek Powazek ](http://www.powazek.com)‘s [{city stories}](http://www.citystories.com) network. It’s being maintained by Cam Barrett, who is apparently getting a head start on the whole thing with [today’s entry](http://www.camworld.com/journal/2001/02/#27) detailing some of the fun stuff he’s spotted.

I’ve got lots of New York Stories, and most of ’em have to do with the subways… I should start remembering them and writing ’em down.
