I was just poking around [VeriSign’s site](http://www.verisign.com/products/signing/index.html), even thought I hate the company, because I was thinking about digital signatures today. Why isn’t there any cheap or free way to sign code or Office documents? I don’t want to drop $400 on that kind of crap, but I would spend $25 or so.

Makes me wish there were some open-source security root that I could use. Or is there? Maybe I just don’t know about it.
