Just because I’m proud of myself, I’m letting you all know that I found out today that I’ll shortly be starting **my new job** at [The Village Voice](http://www.villagevoice.com/).

Where they’re so generous, they hired me even *after* seeing the way my site looks in Netscape 4. [Gimme love](javascript:viewComments(4072694))! ( echo commentCount(4072694); ?>)
