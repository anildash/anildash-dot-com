[Rapatronic Photographs:](http://simplethinking.com/home/rapatronic_photographs.htm)

> Developed by Dr. Harold Edgerton in the 1940s, the Rapatronic photographic technique allowed very early times in a nuclear explosionâ€™s fireball growth to be recorded on film. The exposures were often as short as 10 nanoseconds, and each Rapatronic camera could take exactly one photograph.
