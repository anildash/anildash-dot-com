So Spring is blooming everywhere, and with it, renewal. Even [Brad](http://www.bradlands.com)‘s getting into the act. But now I find myself wanting to do something with this site that’s been kicking around in my head for a while…

See, I know some people like the geeky tech stuff. And I know some people who come here like the, um, *other* stuff. So I’m thinking of splitting them into two separate parts of this site. But I’ll need [some feedback](mailto:anil@dashes.com) from you people. Please let me know what you prefer…
