Amazon is offering a [free download of one of my favorite songs ever](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000059S37/). It’s a terrific version of a beautiful song, Everything But The Girl’s cover of Jobim’s “[Corcovado](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_08_01_archive.php#4920761)“. Go get it, listen to it, and you’ll know what it’s like to be in range of a stereo when I have control over it.

Oh, and give the Red Hot people some money, too.
