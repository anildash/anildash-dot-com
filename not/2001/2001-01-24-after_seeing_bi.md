After seeing [Bill](http://www.marginalia.org)‘s link and discussing it with him, I figured I’ll just put up some of the [Lomax recordings](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_01_01_archive.php#1994706) that Moby sampled.

First up is Bessie Jones’ "[Sometimes](stuff/BessieJones-Sometimes.mp3)" which I believe Moby used in "Honey". This one had a rhythm all by itself, no drum machines needed. Next up, Willie Jones, Boy Blue and Joe Lee himself present "[Joe Lee’s Rock](stuff/BoyBlue,WillieJones,JoeLee-JoeLee'sRock.mp3). I think Moby’s corresponding track is called "Find My Baby".

You first heard Vera Hall’s "[Trouble So Hard](stuff/VeraHall-TroubleSoHard.mp3) in "Natural Blues". And while these are downloading, go napsearch Spoonie Gee and The Treacherous Three’s "[Love Rap](nap:search?artist=spoonie&amp;title=love+rap)" to hear the genesis of "Bodyrock".
