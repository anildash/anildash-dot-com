> I will set up one of those “I will write your name in some kind of fake ass calligraphy with like rainbows and peacocks and shit” booths in Times Square. I actually think that would be kind of funny– some guy who sets up shop next to all the other street artists and calligraphers and whatnot, only his renderings are really really terrible. Not even amateurish, just like, terrible. I would write people’s names in the same block letter style I used when rendering the AC/DC or Rush logos on my middle school notebooks and folders.

I’m glad [Fred](http://www.metascene.net/weblog.html)‘s moving to New York. He’s a natural.
