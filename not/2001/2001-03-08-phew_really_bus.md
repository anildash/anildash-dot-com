Phew! Really busy today getting ready for SXSW. I have a couple of days’ worth of entries set to pop up on this page while I’m gone, so it would update itself. But I’m a big believer in fresh content, so I’ve also gotten my friend [Jon](http://smile_sessions.blogspot.com) to guest-host until next week. This is because he’s a good writer and a good friend, and he also tends to have subject matter that’s more interesting to me than my own writing, a lot of the time.

So you all be nice to him as he plays Joan Rivers to my Johnny Carson, and I will see many of you in Texas. Yee-haw!
