I love the web. I was showing my mom how Blogger works and how I do my site, and I posted the request below to ask about business cards. Five minutes later, [Heather](http://www.harrumph.com) sent me a link to [4by6](http://www.4by6.com). (Which looks excellent, by the way, and comes highly recommended. I think Iâ€™ll be using them.) Then [Matt](http://a.wholelottanothing.org) referred me to them a short while later.

Needless to say, my mom was very impressed with all of this. I guess I am too. But sorry Heather and Matt, [PB](http://www.onfocus.com) is still my best friend.
