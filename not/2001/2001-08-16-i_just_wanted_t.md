I just wanted to confirm that cutting one’s own hair with a set of electric clippers is as fantastically a bad idea as one might suppose. It is, however, just as entertaining as one could hope it would be.

I have been cajoled into wearing my self-sheared scalp to work tomorrow, and I am quite looking forward to seeing what the reaction will be. And then presumably, at lunch, a real haircut. But until then, I look like a pack of wolves assaulted me from the neck up. Try it yourself, it’s hours of safe, enjoyable fun for the whole family!
