Well, I didn’t mention it before when I talked about getting a new job, but I really see me getting employed as a win for all of us on the jobless side of things. Any of us making progress represents an advance for the whole team. Rest assured, I spent months sending out cover letters and resumes into the ether, with **no response to most of them**, and even getting interviews and waiting around fruitlessly for call-backs that never came.

I’m still rooting for all of you that are toughing it out, don’t worry. Take consolation in this: I found a position which meets every single goal I would have for a job, chief among them that it’s a company and organization that I can feel passionate about. **I’m sure you’ll find one, too**.
