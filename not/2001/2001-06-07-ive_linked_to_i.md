Iâ€™ve linked to it here before, but the [AT&T Labs Interactive TTS Demo](http://www.research.att.com/~mjm/cgi-bin/ttsdemo) is well worth checking out. TTS is Text to Speech, meaning you type in your (presumably naughty) phrase and the computer will say it.

Hours of safe, enjoyable fun for the whole family.
