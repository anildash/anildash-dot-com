So you all know I got canned, and most of you know it wasn’t on the best possible terms. But I’m a nice guy, so I helped out my ex-boss, who was looking to have someone replace *part* of what I did at my old job, minus all the high-level Biz Dev stuff and really detailed development mucky-muck.

So I put together an ad for the position, and came up with this:

> **Webmaster for streaming media content site**

> Must be fluent in HTML and web scripting. Should be familiar with Photoshop, Illustrator, and all current browsers and media players on Windows and Macintosh platforms. Basic admin and maintenance of a Solaris server via FTP, telnet, and SSH required.

> Prefer experience with PHP and MySQL, or similar background in ASP or Cold Fusion. Extensive knowledge of codecs and encoding in Windows Media, QuickTime, and Real Video is a must. Flash and Director experience a big plus.

So I found out he wants to advertise for this replacement person at a salary of $25,000. **In Manhattan.** (For those of you from out of town, a *parking space* across the street from where I live costs $320 a month. Extrapolate.)

Perhaps it is only in hindsight that we realize how lucky we are.
