There are days and times when all the inspiration I can find is to read about “[What’s Going On](http://books.guardian.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,615183,00.html)” and then listen to the album, front to back.

It’s all the inspiration one needs, really. Go read the article, and see how hard Marvin fought for us all to get to hear it.
