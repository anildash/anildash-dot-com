You know, I thought I was the only one with the **attention span of a gnat**, but I guess it afflicts many bloggers. Either that, or we shift to new things pretty quickly once the novelty wears off. Case in point, [ourpinions.com](http://www.register.com/whois-results.cgi?3b00391ca09e6cd349e7858793bdfc97e4a8531cf6d98e6e244ea676a08034b4).
