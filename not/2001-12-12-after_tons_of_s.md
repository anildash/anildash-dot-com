After tons of [speculation](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_12_01_archive.php#7668917), the device known as “WHAT” (or “Danza”) is at last revealed to be the [Megway HT](http://web.0sil8.com/).

This thing is gonna be bigger than the Beatles!

**Update:** As MetaFilter’s server (which hosts the demo movie) is getting overwhelmed, I’ve mirrored the Megway Demo movie [here](__GHOST_URL__/anil/stuff/megway.mov). [Jason](http://www.kottke.org) told me last night that this is what happens when Meg, Jason and Matt aren’t working. And by golly, if that’s true, then I hope they stay unemployed forever!

Wait, that’s not right…
