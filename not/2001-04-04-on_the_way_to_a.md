On the way to an interview today, a group of young girls across from me on the subway were talking about [this school bomb threat](http://www.nydailynews.com/2001-04-03/News_and_Views/City_Beat/a-105827.asp). The remarkable thing about the conversation was that these young girls were all at least acquaintances with the young woman, and they were so incredibly savvy about the whole process.

The only subject of debate was who had turned the suspect in, and what the outcome of her suspension hearing had been. The mechanics of reporting a threat and the assumption that it would result in police involvement were seen as par for the course, and I found myself wishing I could have followed the conversation further.

The Daily News should have been listening to this conversation. The NYPD should have been *part* of this conversation. The Board of Education shouldnâ€™t have even needed to hear it. But as, always, the kids that know the most, that have the most to offer, that could help the most, will probably be ignored.
