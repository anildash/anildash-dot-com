Hmmm. A tool to [migrate Apache settings to IIS](http://www.microsoft.com/ISN/downloads/migration_toolsP65238.asp?A=4) is supposed to be available by the end of the month. I had thought about scripting something like this, intersting to see how well Microsoft does at reading the httpd.conf and converting it to Registry entries. For reference, most of the equivalencies are available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/iis/steps.asp#f).

I think I blogged that before [back in October](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2000_10_01_archive.php#1172288).
