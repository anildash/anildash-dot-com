Gen’s got a nice link and backgrounder on [Seal’s impending new release](http://www.kanai.net/weblog/archives/001347.html). In typical Seal fashion, I’ve seen a good bit of promotion for the song, but haven’t heard it yet. I’d figured him for commerically dead when the Worst Batman Movie Ever resuscitated him, so I suppose it’s possible he’ll get sent back up the charts by that invisible but lucrative Sade/Annie Lennox audience.
