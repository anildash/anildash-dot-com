Today my Internet taught me about the [Mexican kids who love Morrissey](http://www.laweekly.com/ink/02/24/a.shtml), which I knew nothing about. Los Smiths, whoâ€™d have figured? [Andre](http://torrez.org) informs me that Morrissey apparently has adopted and welcomed his new fanbase, much to the chagrin of the suburban shoe-gazing white kids who loved him first. Heh. Something new to mope about.
