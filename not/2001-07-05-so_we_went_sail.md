So we went sailing today on Long Island Sound. A beautiful day, a perfect way to spend the day off. The recurring motif that I’ve been hearing from people all day is that we’re suprised there’s not more hullabaloo over this being the 225th birthday for the United States. We tend to love those nice round numbers.
