Matt talks about being [at the helm of a shitstorm](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/11/behind_the_webs.html): "I’d hate to see blogs get known for reactionary authors".

I think it may be too late. Having been the instigator of a few minor ones and having borne the brunt of some pretty violent blogosphere shitstorms, I think we’ve already got a well-deserved reputation for going off half-cocked.

I’m hoping we don’t permanently end up with a reputation as an [unkind community](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/10/11/an_unkind_commu), but I see little discussion of the [social implications of the blogging medium](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/10/ramblings_on_go.html).
