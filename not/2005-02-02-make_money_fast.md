I guess ad space on blogs is worth something. Remember back when Google wouldn’t let bloggers run AdSense on their sites? Now they’re [spamming people to convince them to do it](http://overstated.net/05/02/01-googles-adsense-spam). I’m sure it’s just a case of overzealous sales people, and I can imagine it’s hard to get the corporate culture of a Silicon Valley company communicated to hard-charging deal-closers in the midtown Manhattan office, but it’s still uncharacteristically clueless. I’m betting these emails are from people who aren’t exactly lovers of the web.

I’m also wondering where “Compelling value-add” fits into the list of bullet points. Somewhere in between “Don’t Be Evil” and “Jerry Garcia’s Cook”, I should think.
