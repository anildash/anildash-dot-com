Even though I’ve got a great job now, not everything is perfect about the gig. For example, I’ve been insisting to anyone who’d listen for the past few months that our company’s esteemed [co-founders](http://sixapart.com/about/#founders) aren’t actually [husband and wife](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000852), but are *siblings*. The White Stripes of the weblog industry.

Though I found my gag slightly amusing, some people have no sense of of when a joke is being taken too far. I actually spent the better part of half an hour waiting friday night before we went out to a party, as Ben and Mena were trying to put together co-ordinated [red and white outfits](http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_3/images/music-8-16-02-white-stripes.jpg). Much to their chagrin, they were unsuccessful and had to settle for dressing like actual normal humans when in public. Hello, Trotts? It’s a TrackBack ping to your outfits, being sent from Dorkville.

While I’m really enjoying being a part of Six Apart, I have to say that I’ve got some reluctance to be part of the "wacky outfits" tradition of the company. I’m kind of concerned about the precedents being set, lest I find out that pretty soon that I’m going to be forced to wear a paper hat, a name tag, and a couple dozen pieces of flair.
