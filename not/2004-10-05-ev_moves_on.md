Congrats to Ev on [finishing his tenure at Google](http://www.evhead.com/2004/10/next.asp). Ev’s work, and the talent of the people he’s had working with him over the past decade, have both been big inspirations to me, and I’m glad it’s ended up with him in a position where he can pursue new challenges.

It’s an interesting parallel, as I was happy a few weeks ago to learn about Meg deciding to [follow her heart](http://www.megnut.com/2004/09/from-geek-to-chef) as well. Part of the reason they’ve both been given the opportunity to choose what they do next is because they were integral to doing work that, surprisingly enough, actually managed to change the world.

So, it seems like two people who influenced me a long time ago, whom I’ve come to know as friends in the years since, have been rewarded for their good work by getting to do what inspires and challenges them.

Man, I love it when the good guys win.
