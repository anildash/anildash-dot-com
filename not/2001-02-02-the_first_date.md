[![nothing says love better.](images/ship.gif)](http://www.explodingdog.com/june19/sayslove.html)

The first date I ever went on, we stopped by Toys R Us while driving around for a few hours. I bought a model ship, since I was head over heels for the girl and I intended to finish the model in time to give it to her on some significant anniversary in the future.

I never finished the ship, though. So I like this picture.

Yes, I was old enough to own a car on my first date.
