Mastodon and the fediverse have captured a tremendous amount of media hype as mismanagement drives Twitter to implode. Here's how to understand the opportunity for brands, institutions and organizations in this new world, and how to safely engage with the fediverse — based on learning from those who've been there from the start.

First, a little bit of background: Many of the same people who built the first wave of social networks (those that predated Facebook and Twitter) anticipated all of the risks we are seeing in the chaos around Twitter today. From capricious content policies to frustration with algorithms to discomfort with the whims of ownership, the pioneers who created much of the technologies that underly the modern web knew that these problems could, and would, arise.

So, they set out to build open systems that would be far less vulnerable to these kinds of faults and flaws. And you already use some of these systems, like every time you subscribe to — or publish — a podcast. The reason you don't hear bad-faith arguments about podcasts being "shadowbanned", or fussing about the algorithm silencing people's podcasts is because it's built on some of the same infrastructure (both technical and philosophical) that underpins the fediverse, and the fediverse's most famous tool, Mastodon.

There are a lot of technical explainers about Mastodon, typically aimed at individual users who want to sign up for one of the servers that offers a Mastodon account. This is not one of those guides. An important point to remember here is that there is not going to be some single Twitter killer that everybody migrates to. The audience for realtime engagement platforms is splintering, likely for good. There are going to be lots of new apps and services that all loosely connect to one another, and it's going to take years for them to mature. The single platform that serves as the one @name is not going to come back, and the global audience that thinks of there being one place to see the real-time conversation is nearing its end.

Instead, what we'll cover here are a few points:

- How we know that the fediverse will get critical mass that makes it worthwhile to invest in
- Where to place your bets on technology and strategy as you explore a presence in the fediverse
- What to expect in terms of tools and culture as the fediverse becomes more mainstream
- Some things that even experienced Mastodon users may not know about the future of the fediverse

What I'm not trying to do is convince you "your company needs to be on Mastodon!" There's no rush, and FOMO is a foolish reason to adopt a new platform. And, for what it's worth, your move into the fediverse may very well not involve _Mastodon_ at all.

## How do we know the fediverse is worth betting on?

First, some quick background on the terminology: "fediverse" is a colloquial way of referring to all of the various apps and services that connect with each other using ActivityPub, a technical standard for open social media. A good way of thinking of it is like podcasting — there are lots of different tools that can create, edit, publish, distribute, or play back a podcast. But they all basically work together, and the underlying technology (in podcasting, that's RSS) is mostly hidden beneath a whole ecosystem of useful tools for both producers and consumers.

As I write this, Mastodon is the "brand name" that consumers and casual evaluators of technology know better than "fediverse". (For what it's wroth, I think both are pretty poor brands.) But it's just the most visible current implementation of the tech; it's a little bit like when Soundcloud was the place that most folks started a new podcast. Many consumers are confused by the idea that there are multiple Mastodon servers, which geeks tend to explain away by saying "it's like email, where everyone can have their own server and they all talk to each other". But first, very few people have ever stopped to think about how email servers work, so this analogy sucks just as a starting point. And second, it's even _worse_ than this analogy implies, because we're trying to imagine all the ways companies might use email and we're at a stage where Gmail or Hotmail don't even exist yet. Yet even at this early stage, we can picture organizations being able to seamlessly direct their followers from twitter-style text updates to realtime notifications about video or photos or rich media, all without being subject to the whims of any one particular tech tycoon. That's the [awesome power of a fully operational metaverse](https://georgeclinton.com/audio/george-clinton-the-p-funk-allstars-t-a-p-o-a-f-o-m/).

But we're not there yet. So why should you waste time learning about this stuff? Well, a couple of reasons:

- Fediverse adoption trends are astounding — Mastodon alone (which is only part of the fediverse) is already bigger than Twitter was when Oprah joined, and it's growing faster week-over-week than Twitter did for most of its existence, while also topping the App Store charts without a single dollar in ad spending.
- Elon is just going to pull the rug out from beneath you again, but worse. And even if Twitter isn't vital to your social strategy, you need a presence in this type of network in order to be able to do rapid response or crisis comms as needed. Of course, that's also knowing your Facebook or Instagram account can be shut down at any time, for any reason, with no accountability, and even if it's not, you endure brand risk simply by being on their platforms.
- Mainstream consumers are fatigued by the vagaries of today's social platforms, even if they can't specifically articulate that stress. It's a lot like security and privacy — consumers want these benefits, even if they can't specifically describe what they need.
  Early adopters and creatives are already rushing to fediverse platforms, despite the lack of guard rails like sufficient content moderation, monetization models, analytics/metrics, and other essentials. We're seeing the floodgates open even despite the glaring shortcomings in the platform, and that's always a sign that there's pent-up demand that will only increase even more when the rocky roads of the fediverse are smoothly paved.
- The non-centralized, democratically-owned nature of the fediverse also fits in culturally with where creatives and innovators are headed. These days, there's a broad skepticism over hyper-capitalism in all of its forms, but perhaps nowhere more so than in the form of the giant technology platforms. Far more creators and artists are aware of the importance of being able to own their own work and have control over their own destiny. The fediverse arrives at exactly the right moment to tap into every trend from the resurgence of organized labor to the rise of the creator economy.
- Sometimes, technology just follows cycles. By every appearance, we are trending back towards a more open cycle that mimics the internet of the early 2000s. A lot of the hype around "web3" was trying to opportunistically seize this genuine trend and tie it to blockchain hype, but as that bubble bursts, what remains is the substance — an internet that lets more people and organizations thrive.

This is probably a good time to mention my own credentials: I've been building open and decentralized social media tools and platforms since the social web was invented, led a MacArthur-backed research project on the policy impacts of social media in 2009, advised everyone from the Obama White House to \[insert your favorite too-online celeb here\] on their use of social media, and oversee Glitch, the community of millions of coders where a lot of the most interesting and vital fediverse apps are being created along with millions of other open web apps. Put another way, even the fediverse experts who don't like me will likely begrudgingly concede that I've been deep into this stuff for decades.

**Recommendation:** Bet on the fediverse because it's growing quickly, and creators and culture are ready for the resilience and opportunity that it offers them.

## Where should I place my bets?

First: **Take your time.** It's easy to feel (especially with Twitter constantly getting more chaotic) like you have to make a decision about a new social platform _right now_. But now is the perfect time to be strategic and fully think through your organizational goals, and use that to inform your choices of both technology and strategy.

Take, for example, Mastodon. Here, I mean Mastodon the _software_, it's the tool that underlies all the various Mastodon communities that exist. It's made by a nice community, led by a decent guy, and is scaling extraordinarily well given the onrush of millions of new users unexpectedly showing up. (When Twitter was at similar scale, and had countless millions of dollars in funding, its site was falling over constantly.) But Mastodon may not be the technology that brings organizations to the fediverse, even if it remains the dominant consumer brand.

Mastodon is clearly the first platform that has catalyzed a move to the fediverse, and may even remain the face of the consumer fediverse, but doesn't seem likely to be the tool that brings broad adoption by organizations like companies, non-profits, government agencies, and major brands. Mastodon is — wonderfully! — designed to be fairly non-commercial by nature, and the moderators of the major instances (instances are individual Mastodon communities) have deep technical knowledge that's often paired with surprisingly strong community management skills. But today's Mastodon community admins are not primarily interested in being of value to institutions. Which is _good_! Their stewardship and anti-institutional bias is why the fediverse was resilient enough to be waiting for the moment when the rest of the web needed them.

But it's very easy to imagine what a set of non-Mastodon tools for organizations in the fediverse will look like in the near future. First we'll see just some technical improvements — easier technical administration, a simpler and more familiar user interface, better performance for large follower counts, and integration with other tools like the existing social media management suites. My informed guess here is that this will not happen on Mastodon, but will likely be one of the newer tools like [Takahē](https://jointakahe.org), that's being built with a different set of technical and architectural choices that make it a closer fit to what many businesses and agencies are used to. (You'll notice if you visit that link that there's currently nothing like a consumer experience there; that reflects the fact that it will be months until we see something that's ready for regular businesses to use.) If fediverse tools follow the pattern set by technologies like content management systems (which seems likely), we'll see a handful of popular tools rise into broad usage, likely as open source products, and a few pioneering organizations will collaborate around helping make those tools more robust, feature-filled, and boring.

More importantly, we don't yet have the moderation and risk-reduction infrastrucure tools for the fediverse that organizations rely on when managing things like email. For example, most people in your organization don't have to think about it consciously, but your email provider does a _lot_ of work to block spam emails and phishing scams, to the point where it's rare that any get through to ordinary users. That took decades of coordinated work from countless numbers of email administrators around the world, iterating on various formal and informal practices for increasing the reliability and trustworthiness of the entire email ecosystem. We'll need to see tools that let organizations share each other's work on moderation, blocklists for bad actors, best practices on content policy, standardized rules for employee participation in systems, data retention and auditing concerns, and much more. And of course we can expect new vendors to arise who will help organizations manage all of these new challenges by fitting into familiar purchase and procurement processes.

In the meantime, until such tools are widely available and mature, there will be some simpler ways that organizations get started. A few early companies have just signed up for accounts on the major Mastodon instances. That seems like a suboptimal but understandable starting point, especially given that you can often migrate your followers from one fediverse service to another. (Though do note — this is an imperfect solution and does not bring over your content.) But over time, just as you'd expect a company's email address to be on their own domain, I think it will start to look a bit peculiar if a company's fediverse presence asks you to follow them on `AcmeCorp@RandomMastodon.server`. (Those of you who are old enough may recall a time when companies would launch a blog with blogspot.com or wordpress.com in the URL, but these days, you'd expect to see it at `blog.example.com`. The fediverse will quickly follow a similar pattern.)

**Recommendation:** Rather than going all-in at once, build a budget that provides resources for experimentation and iteration over time, and assume you'll be evaluating new technologies and tools along the way.
