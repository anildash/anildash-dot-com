I regularly use about a dozen different social web services, with dozens more that I have accounts on. Historically, I’ve used one of a very small number of photos of myself as my avatar or user icon on these websites.

The other evening, I spent about an hour replacing my image on as many sites as I could find, because I thought it was time to replace my photo with a picture I discovered a few weeks ago. It’s the awesomest photo ever.
