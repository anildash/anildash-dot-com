After being inspired by trying to help [Matt](http://a.wholelottanothing.org) in his struggles to add the “currently listening to:” item on his site, I added a Now Playing box over there on the sidebar. After judicious amounts of elbow grease, it links to the Amazon page for the artist’s most popular record. I was originally trying to have it link to the album the song is from, but it required just a wee bit too much effort.
