Today is break my own rules day. First I will talk about other people’s websites, which I usually hate doing. But I’ll make an exception since some people are going to be abandoning their sites for a while. To [Lance](http://www.glassdog.com), [Ernie](http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com), [Jason](http://www.kottke.org) , [Saima](http://www.saimasays.com/) and [Cam](http://www.camworld.com), enjoy your hiatuses.

I wanted to let everyone know that while they’re all super-cool folks who take breaks from their sites, I am so cool that I’ve already *taken* a break and come back. I’m so far ahead of the curve, it’s a straight line to me.

Second, I’m going to resort to some [Bush-Bashing](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_04_01_archive.php#3279404) and gratuitous TV-as-shared-cultural-experience [pop culture](http://www.dashes.com/anil/093099.html) references. Because Bush’s recent bumbling has made me wonder if he keeps walking into the Oval Office, getting stopped by security, and then presenting a note saying “Please let George be in charge of the country. Signed, [Epstein’s Mother](http://www.rollanet.org/~khigh/kotter.html).”
