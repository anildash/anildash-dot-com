After seeing how this [terrorist bombing plot was narrowly averted](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=519&amp;e=8&amp;u=/ap/20020824/ap_on_re_us/townhouse_bombs_9), I think it’s clear that it’s time to begin with the racial profiling. It doesn’t make sense to be checking elderly grandmothers anymore, let’s focus on who the real suspects are. Let’s not forget what [the real face of terrorism](http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/08/24/florida.explosives/index.html) looks like.
