I’d like to see a structured web publishing tool that would let me geoencode Wikipedia entries in the same way that many blogs use GeoURL. Then, I’d want to be able to access Wikipedia’s content with a wikipedia.org/*latitude*/*longitude* format of URL, listing every entry relevant to a location in one single page. And then finally, a GPS- or location-aware mobile device that would have one-button access to that local page from anywhere that I am.
