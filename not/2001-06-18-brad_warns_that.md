Brad warns that he might become a [semi-professional punctuation curmudgeon]([http://www.bradlands.com/weblog/2001-06.shtml#June](http://www.bradlands.com/weblog/2001-06.shtml#June) 17, 2001), like [this guy](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/16/world/16ENGL.html).

It was at the point of Bradâ€™s confession that I realized I could make **a confession of my own**: I had considered starting a section of this site for my digital camera pictures of spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors in public places.

At least I know [some people](http://www.kottke.org) would appreciate it.
