Well, I updated my [About](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?about.php#info) page a bit. The main thing I did is to add links to my [Keirsey](http://keirsey.com) temperament types. I’m a fairly even mix between [ENTP](http://www.geocities.com/lifexplore/entp.htm) and [INTP](http://www.geocities.com/lifexplore/intp.htm), although I think I identify more with the former.

One of the great joys of reading these descriptions is the painful familiarity of the negative personality types that are listed. They’re always good for a rueful smile. And, as an added bonus, it [annoys morons like these](http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/temper.htm).

[Discuss](javascript:viewComments(3425286)) your personality type. Or tell me how accurate those descriptions of me are. ( echo commentCount(3425286); ?>)
