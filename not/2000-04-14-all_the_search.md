All the search engines I know of ([let me know](mailto:anil@dashes.com) if I’m wrong) **parse out the scripting and comments** in a site’s HTML when they spider it, but I was thinking there might be a market for a [Google](http://www.google.com) or [AltaVista](http://www.altavista.com) that parses everything *but* the script, so you could search for implementations of a particular function or idea in other people’s sites.

Anyone know of a search engine like that? Or better yet, anyone want to make one and then pay me royalties?
