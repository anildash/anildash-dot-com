[Jack](http://www.saturn.org/?x=archive&amp;y=2001_01_07_archive#1936412)‘s done a wonderful job of evoking **the visceral, emotional impact of *owning* a music recording**. My big-ass CD collection has always served two roles for me; I have a few CD’s that are among the most valuable things I own, and then I have a large number of "souvenir" recordings which document moments or memories for me just by their very presence.

And certainly, Napster’s cut down the number of items in that second category. Transient flings with singles, songs that I had a crush on for a summer or so, are the reason I keep Napster running all day. But nothing could replace the few CD’s or records that I think of as the heart of my collection; Indeed, it saddens me that very few songs today make me want to add them to that part of the collection…

I miss wasting all my money on CD’s.
