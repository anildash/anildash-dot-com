**Cool!** From a page on [LucasArts.com](http://www.lucasarts.com/products/forcecommander/downloads.htm), you can download a few MP3’s of their own remixes of Star Wars’ Imperial March. Granted, I think *I* could do better if I had access all the Darth Vader samples, etc. that they do, but still, they’re not bad.
