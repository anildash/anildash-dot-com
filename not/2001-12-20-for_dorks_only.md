For dorks only: a [nearly comprehensive list](http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/howitworks/management/w2kservices.asp) of the services that are installed by default in Windows 2000. (And, for the most part, in Windows XP as well.) Go through and pick out the ones you donâ€™t need, and [disable them](http://www.pureperformance.com/NT/ms/ms04.htm). Fewer services running = better performance.
