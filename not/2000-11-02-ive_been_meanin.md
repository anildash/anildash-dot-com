I’ve been meaning to praise [Jish’s new design](http://www.jish.nu/) for a while now. I like that he’s always led with pictures of himself on the page, it really gives his blog personality. And makes me want to get off my ass and redesign here. Actually, it’s mostly done already, i just have to tweak it.
