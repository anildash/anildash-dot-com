Itâ€™s incredibly cold, and I wanted to experience some of the futuristic convenience that the web promises to deliver (literally), so I went to [Kozmo.com](https://www.kozmo.com/cgi-bin/ncommerce/;execmacro/category/home_full.d2w/report?Krypto=XmtfDDSEzDe0fKiAdhiiwxqRDA/QqaIRuOnptiUjh1w1GbFr0YypAg==) and got the following message:

> **Due to inclement weather and excessive order volumes the site will be down until 9:30 p.m.**

And then on to [UrbanFetch](http://www.urbanfetch.com), where the top of the site read:

> **To process existing orders in a safe and efficient manner, Urbanfetch will only accept orders for delivery after 10:30 PM today. Thank you for your patience.**

Not as bad, but still unsatisfactory. Way to go, losers.
