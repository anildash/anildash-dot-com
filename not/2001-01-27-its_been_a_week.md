It’s been a week, so I’m going to let the link to the [Blogger Pro page](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?proinfo.php) scroll off now. I recognize that the [poll results](http://tools.arsdigita.com/voxpopuli/ViewResults?poll_id=2836&amp;poll_question_id=2915) are skewed, because the audience is self-selecting. That is, only people who have in interest in Pro would be there in the first place, so the percentage that would be willing to pay is probably artificially inflated.

That being said, I think it bodes extremely well for Pyra that **80 percent of respondents would be willing to pay** for the services of Blogger Pro, as of this writing. Granted, almost a third of those recipients would only pay 2 bucks a month, which is probably unfeasibly low. But, assuming that those willing to pay $10 or $20 would also be willing to pay $5, a majority of visitors to this site would cough up $60 a year. That’s an incredible conversion rate; It should be interesting to see how all of this evolves when the service goes live.

And to answer the most frequently asked question, *no*, that goofy little graphic is **not an official Blogger Pro logo**, I did that in about 2 minutes on my own. I’m sure the real one will look much better, but right now there isn’t an official Pro logo yet.
