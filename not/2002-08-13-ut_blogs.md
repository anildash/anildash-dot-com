A Network World story entitled [Blogs finding fans in business world](http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0812blog.html) alleges that Phillip Windley, Utah’s state CIO, is testing weblogs in a business environment. I’m a little skeptical of that claim, given the significant differences between state government and private industry employees, but it’s still a significant rollout of the technology.

> In June [Windley] launched a program that encourages 2,000 IT staffers and about 18,000 other state employees to use Weblogging software for what might be called strategic noodling.
