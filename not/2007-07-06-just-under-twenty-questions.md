I was very flattered and a little bit surprised to be interviewed by [Claire Zulkey](http://www.zulkey.com/) for her site. I’m a fair bit geekier than most of her regular interviewees, but it was still a lot of fun and I talked about parts of my day job and what goes into it that I usually don’t talk about anywhere. So, if you’re interested in that sort of thing, go [check it out](http://www.zulkey.com/2007/07/i_will_be_including_as.php).

It features me saying, “I don’t see any hipsters here in the East Village who are running out to learn how to code in Ruby on Rails just to pick up chicks” and other bits of startlingly-obvious observations wisdom.
