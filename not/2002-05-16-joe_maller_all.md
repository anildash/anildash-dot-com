One of the most interesting people I’ve met in the past few weeks is [Joe Maller](http://www.joemaller.com). In addition to being an influential techie writer since the early days of the web ([Matt](http://haughey.com) once told me "Joe’s the reason I became a web developer" and I can remember reading Joe’s stuff during my formative web days, too.) he’s a terrific filmmaker. An extraordinary eye for the simple and a wonderfully droll, dry sense of humor.

My favorite film on his site is [All Day Ice Cream](http://www.joemaller.com/adic.shtml). It just makes sense to me.
