I know I shouldn’t be saying this, and I understand that it’s only because things have been stressful at Pyra recently, but I’ve really been enjoying seeing [Jack](http://www.saturn.org)‘s replies to the [Blogger discussion threads](http://www.blogger.com/discuss/d.pyra) getting more and more curt and succinct every day.
