I’m starting to reconcile myself to the fact that I actually still enjoy a number of R. Kelly songs, but it is while listening to his exhortations at the beginning of the "[Step in the Name of Love](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007E8J1/2020-20)" remix that I have trouble accepting. Mr. Kelly describes himself to his audience as the "Pied Piper of R&B". I know it’s nothing new, but it just seems, well, fucked up.

Now, I don’t mean to judge harshly a man who’s into videotaped pedophilic golden showers, but perhaps, of all the folkloric sobriquets which one could adopt, a persona associated with the *use of music to lead children away* might not be the best possible choice. Speaking stricly from a branding perspective, of course.

I’m just sayin’.
