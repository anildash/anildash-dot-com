[K-Meleon](http://kmeleon.sourceforge.net/) caught my eye a long time ago, but it looks like it hasn’t been updated since forever. If they’d just update it now that Mozilla 1.0 is released, I could put it on my ClearType-enabled XP system with LCD, and it’d be like [Chimera](http://chimera.mozdev.org/) for Windows.

Speaking of things Mozilla, holy good god is that splash screen ugly. Go get yerself a decent one [here](http://www.slater.ch/moz/). Just save it as mozilla.bmp in your Moz folder.
