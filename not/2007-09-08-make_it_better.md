One of the things I love most about my job is that sense of discovery you get from working with people that are chock-full of good ideas. One great example is Brad Choate’s [100+ iPhone Feature suggestions](http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2007/09/08/100-plus-iphone-features-i-want). I don’t have an iPhone, but I love the sense that he could have just kept reeling off desired improvements infinitely, especially since he’s the kind of guy who can actually make some of these requests happen, even if Apple doesn’t indulge.
