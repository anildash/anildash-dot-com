[Nick](http://www.nickdenton.org/archives/2002_08_01_archive.htm#85344422)‘s finally announced [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/), a geek-toy weblog written by Peter Rojas. And, yeah, Pete’s getting paid to do it. I’ve been watching the content evolve and the links pour in for a few weeks now, and I think that the site is interesting. Will it be profitable? I think it’s *possible* but it’s much more likely to break even long-term.

Which, for the publishing industry, ain’t too bad.
