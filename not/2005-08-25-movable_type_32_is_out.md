[![Powered by Movable Type 3.2](http://www.dashes.com/anil/anil/images/obfeomc.gif)](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) Holy cow! Movable Type 3.2 is finally released, after tons and tons of hard work by the whole team. I’m always excited when we release new stuff at Six Apart ([which we do a lot](http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/08/around_the_six.html)), but this is our only product that actually goes out the door instead of being hosted, so it just feels different.

I’ll save the “I’m so proud of you” stuff for our internal blogs, but for now, I’d just tell everyone to try it out. After all the work we put in, I’m completely shameless about writing a post to pimp ourselves out. MT’s now super-simple to install, lets you have unlimited blogs (even on the free version) and lets you manage all those blogs in one place. I could go on, but there’s [dozens of other features](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2005/06/movable_type_32_is_comin.html) we’ve already talked about. In short, Movable Type 3.2 kicks ass.
