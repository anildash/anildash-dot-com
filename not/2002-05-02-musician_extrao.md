[Musician Extraordinaire](http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/7609/musician_extraordinaire.html) features a spectacular MIDI version of a cover of Hot Butter’s “Popcorn” in a piano fugue style. If you’re like me (but, alas, you’re not) you’ll love it.

Other selected highlights are the compelling cover of Toto’s “Africa” as a polka, and the truly formidable “Theme to Jeopardy!” (“You’ve heard it a million times, but have you ever heard it done as an EXCITING SAMBA?”) I only regret that the links to the Pachelbel/Greenday “Canon in D” medley and the “slightly more orchestral version” of Corey Hart’s “Sunglasses at Night” didn’t seem to be working.
