**Ugh**. The phrase "Viral Marketing" has already come and gone, but someone must have forgotten to tell the folks at the (revoltingly named) [Epidemic.com](http://www.epidemic.com/indexe.jhtml). Even worse, their "service" is a system to put **ads in your personal emails**. If only they could change the subjects on my emails to **Make Money Fast !!!!** theyâ€™d be *completely* worthless.

And, to prove my point about **dot-com advertising on the Super Bowl being pointless**, epidemic is one of the companies shilling out millions for the privilege of having partiers ignore their URL on Sunday.
