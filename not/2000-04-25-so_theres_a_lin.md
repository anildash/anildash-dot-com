So there’s a [Linux-based PDA](http://www.sem.samsung.co.kr/eng/product/digital/pda/) coming out that looks pretty interesting. I’ll be curious to see how the SlashDot crowd reacts, since they’ve been spending so much time explaining that they want a device like the Palm Pilot with only basic PIM functionality, yet this one is striving for feature parity with the Pocket PC’s. *Now* will they want to play MP3’s on their PDA?

Although their marketing department isn’t helping the effort much when their [FAQ](http://www.sem.samsung.co.kr/eng/product/digital/pda/faq.htm) features copy like this: (Emphasis mine)

> Basically YOPY support Linux OS and it’s the very first products based on Linux and **we believe this new OS will be run over** as main platform in the near future.
