[Brig](http://www.eatonweb.com/) says:

> my attention span is getting seriously shortened. i’m sure it’s not a good thing. this statement is, of course, prompted by another long article which i should read, but won’t.

But of course, this isn’t placing the blame where it *should* be: If Brig can’t make it through that article, (and I know I couldn’t, either) it’s because the presentation of the data **wasn’t usable enough**.

Voila! An excuse for all seasons. "But officer, this highway isn’t *usable* at 55MPH…"
