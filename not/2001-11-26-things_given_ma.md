[Things Given](http://www.fray.com/drugs/things/) makes me wonder what I gave. Having been back at my hometown this weekend gave me a good enough excuse, not that I ever really need one, to ruminate on such things. But there were some good discoveries in the Harrisburg area, too.

Like, for instance: Didja know my l’il ole hometown has a gay club now? Although, as with everything in the area I grew up in, it was rather half-assed. The guys were less toned than any other club’s clientele I’ve ever seen. And I’ve *never* been the only male in a gay club who was wearing Banana Republic clothing.

Also, the DJ was spinning such deep underground club artists as J. Lo, Britney Spears and Janet Jackson. Damn those too-hip scenesters and their obscure dance tracks!
