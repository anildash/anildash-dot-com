**[Ask.com](http://www.ask.com) ponders the unanswerables.** Since being renamed from **Ask Jeeves**, one of my favorite search sites, ask.com, has taken on what I feel could be an overwhelming responsibility.

You see, with a name as broad as "Ask.com", I feel that an Internet newbie might mistake the site for some sort of electronic **Oracle of Delphi**. So I decided to query the site with a few of the great questions of all time, and here were it’s suggestions for questions that it had answers to.

**Why Do Fools Fall In Love?**

This one it handled well. Suggestions included “Am I in love?”, “Where is the fun web site ‘Love Calculator’?”, “What is Love?” (Where’s Haddaway when you need him?), and most amusingly, “Where can I get safety tips on the topic of falls?” which somehow seems oddly appropriate.

Having handled the first question with aplomb, I moved on to a tougher one: **Which came first, the chicken or the egg?**

Unfortunately, this one it nailed. It spit back [a site written just to answer that question](http://www-student.lboro.ac.uk/~cosam/chickegg.html), which I think was a little unfair.

Having failed at this point to come up with any responses which were even vaguely amusing, I decided it was time to try harder. Hence, **“Who’s Your Daddy?”**

Wasn’t even worth the effort. Result? A page of links about [fatherhood](http://www.ask.com/main/askJeeves.asp?origin=0&amp;qSource=4&amp;site_name=Jeeves&amp;metasearch=yes&amp;ask=Who%27s+your+daddy%3F). It’s as if those bastards at ask.com don’t even care about my lame attempts at Internet humor.

Sheesh.
