Two of the posts I’m most proud of having written last year are [Making Something Meaningful](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/07/making-somethin.html) and [How do we judge our tools?](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/07/how-do-we-judge.html). It looks like the sentiment behind those posts is catching on.

- Nick Bradbury on [Conserving your limited attention](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2007/07/conserving-your.html): “When I hear someone complaining about all the feeds competing for their attention, I have to wonder why they don’t just unsubscribe from most of them.”
- Jeremy Zawodny on [Getting off the hype treadmill](http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/009248.html): “I made an conscious decision to drop virtually all “news” sources from my subscription list that felt like breathless hype machines that provided little new insight.”
- And [Steve Rubel](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/07/why-were-like-a.html), who seems to have gotten a lot of conversations started with the conclusion that “[T]he bigger story in the long run is how these sites change business and our society.”
- Mike Torres captures a [related point about insularity](http://mike.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!FBABF8E542F5D5DB!8771.entry), “It used to be fun watching the “A-list” bloggers discover the obvious things that folks outside the U.S., little kids, and even big companies have been tracking for months; sometimes years.”
- There was a nice nod from [O’Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/07/changing_the_ga.html) last week, too.

And of course we visited [the blogosphere’s reality distortion field](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/07/and-will-it-blend-is-considered-introspection.html) yesterday. Now we just have to see if this is just a blip of self-criticism, or if people actually want to change what they pay attention to.
