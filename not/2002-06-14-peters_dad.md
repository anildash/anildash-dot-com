Quite an amusing [scolding](http://peterme.com/archives/00000222.html#2) for us all, courtesy of Peter’s father:

> What Peter seems to mean is that he lives in a world of easy electronic communication, and my biggest peeve against pixelated chatter is the general lack of care and accuracy in its formulation. Nowhere else (except possibly movie reviews) is careless thought so obviously exposed yet so readily accepted.

Well, yeah, that’s true.
