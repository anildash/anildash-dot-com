So [Gawker](http://www.gawker.com) is finally live. I’ve been waiting to post a link until everyone else could read it, but it’s already so much better than it has any reason to be. I’m not much of one for gossip or name-dropping, but somehow they’ve got the tone just perfect enough that I can finally see the bitchy pleasure of it. Congrats and my compliments to [Liz](http://capitalinflux.blogspot.com), [Nick](http://www.nickdenton.org), and [Jason](http://www.kottke.org).
