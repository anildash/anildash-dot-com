David Galbraith has [wisely dissected](http://www.davidgalbraith.org/archives/000828.html)[Blogebrity](http://blogebrity.com/), but I’m going to preemptively call the [Contagious Media Showdown](http://showdown.contagiousmedia.org/) in favor of [Crying While Eating](http://cryingwhileeating.com/). Crying While Eating has that perfect combination of novelty, creepiness, and bodily functions which adds up to a supermeme. Combined with the fact that clips from the site made it onto [Best Week Ever](http://bestweekever.blogs.com/). Sure, there’s a site with underpants that’s beating Crying While Eating right now, but how long can the web remain fascinated by young women in their underwear?
