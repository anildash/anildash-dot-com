How come Slashdot [talks about Google launching a browser](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/09/21/0011207.shtml) when the [New York Post writes about it](http://www.nypost.com/business/30438.htm) when the Post story itself quotes [Jason](http://www.kottke.org/04/08/the-google-browser)[himself](http://www.kottke.org/04/09/more-google-browser)? For all their fuck-the-man open-sourceness, Slashdotters have always struck me as an oddly conservative bunch.
