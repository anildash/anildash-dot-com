A fairly telling sign of my work ethic: During this weekend when I decided to stay home, and be responsible and finish up all the tasks that I’ve been procrastinating, I just went to close the game of [Freecell](http://www.freecell.com) that I’d been playing. "It’s not irresponsible," I always rationalize. "It’s what I do while I’m thinking or brainstorming. Being productive."

So I figured it was time to get down to business. Put on the headphones and focus on the tasks at hand. After all, I’d only been distracted for a moment, right? And now I could resume whatever I’d been working on before. I clicked on the little X to close my Freecell window and reveal the task lurking behind it.

I found another Freecell window, with a half-played game in it. I’m pretty sure *that* wasn’t on the to-do list.
