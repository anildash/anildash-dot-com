An interesting experiment in **pervasive hyperlinking** is taking place at [GuruNet](http://www.gurunet.com). (No relation to [guru.com](http://www.guru.com)) What they make is a small program, sort of like a browser plug-in, that lets you Alt-click on a word in *any* Windows application (not just browsers) and get information on that word.

Right now, the information is mostly limited to **dictionary definitions**, but I’m sure down the road the database of hyperlinks and other resources will vastly expand. The app also has a **great pedigree**, with one of the key investors being Mark Tebbe, who was founder of [Lante](http://www.lante.com), and, until his recent departure, was one of my favorite columnists at [InfoWorld](http://www.infoworld.com).

I think there’s still more than a few **user interface inadequacies** to be resolved in the program, but its potential makes it well worth the small download. However, the biggest flaw that I can see in this program is that there is no accommodation for **user-supplied links**. The best way to tap the potential of a program like this is to allow for the community of users to **contribute to its value**.

My suggestion would be a **three-tiered system**. At the narrowest, and highest-quality, level, only GuruNet-supplied links would be available upon clicking a word, with all links entered and verified by their staff. Limited, sure, but also more likely to be useful.

At the second level would be a **filtered user-supplied directory** of links. Perhaps through a cross-licensing with the database of the [Open Directory](http://www.dmoz.org) or [About.com](http://www.about.com), or simply through editing links suggested by GuruNet users, a high-quality, high-volume database of links could be added to the program.

At the lowest quality, but with the highest quantity, of links would be a **totally open** database, either through passing queries to a standard large search engine ([AltaVista](http://www.altavista.com), [HotBot](http://www.hotbot.com), or maybe a more refined one like [Google](http://www.google.com) or [Northern Light](http://www.northernlight.com).)

Of course, this being a software program, plenty of warnings and "**Are you sure?**"s would have to be added, so that people would realize they were opening up the potential of spam and advertising, etc. I’m assuming that **advertising on GuruNet Alt-clicks** is already part of their long-term revenue model.
