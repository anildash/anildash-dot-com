The [Postal Service](http://www.usps.gov) authorized **online purchase of postage** today, which was pretty much expected since they’ve been working on it for more than a year.

However, some of the reports I’ve read say they authorized *four* providers, while others say two. If it’s four, I have no idea who the last two are, but the first two are easy: [E-stamp](http://www.estamp.com) and [Stamps.com](http://www.stamps.com).

**Addendum**: It *is* only the two providers who have been authorized. And the postage uses the **two-dimensional barcode** (like [UPS](http://www.ups.com) uses) to store the information. It looks like **this**:
