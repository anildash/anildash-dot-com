The E4X support I’d mentioned in [my web trends predictions post](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/09/06/web_development) has just shipped as part of [Firefox 1.5 Beta 1](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/). Though the [the release notes](http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/releases/1.5a2.html#webdev) track a little bit of oddness in what’s required to take advantage of the support, it’s still a very good sign.

Of course, I might be wrong about some of the other points I’ve raised; [a smarter man than me](http://www.franklinmint.fm/blog/archives/000441.html) offers his assessment.
