My fifteen-year-old self would be completely geeked out to find that Dave Navarro and the non-Perry Farrell members of Jane’s Addiction ( otherwise known as “the ones I like”) have a [TypePad site](http://6767.typepad.com/). And seeing [MTV News](http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488662/20040624/story.jhtml) pulling quotes from [the lead singer](http://steveisaacs.typepad.com/) for their new project is just icing on the cake. I don’t really keep up with Jane’s anymore, but I am secretly hoping we get a help ticket from Dave Navarro.
