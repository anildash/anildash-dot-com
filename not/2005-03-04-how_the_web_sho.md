Michal Levy reminds us what we love about the web. With [Giant Steps](http://michalevy.com/gs_main.html), Levy took Coltraneâ€™s masterwork and set it to Flash in a beautiful interpretation. Nothing literal, just a stunning representation of what the music made her see. Go [take a look at the work](http://michalevy.com/gs_download.html) for yourself.
