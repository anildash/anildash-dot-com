There is just some unremovable sheen of *scumbag* that clings to [Larry Ellison](http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2637094,00.html). Stop me if I’ve said this before, but I find it strange that people in this industry demonize Bill Gates when someone like Ellison is still roaming the earth. I wouldn’t leave Ellison alone in a room with my (nonexistent) daughter, what makes him think I’d trust him with my company’s data?

Not to mention the fact that I don’t want to fund his insecure need to buy *actual combat fighter jets* to play with. Or to subsidize his sexual harassment suit settlement fund. Ick. Just repugnant.
