Well, it’s a doozy, but the W3C has come up with a proposal that I think is killer. **[XHTML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/)**. In simplest terms, it’s a reformulation of HTML 4.0 (plus a few updates) as expressed in XML 1.0. Got that?

Now I know this is old news, since the spec’s been out for a month already, but why hasn’t this been made a bigger deal? I know I care more about this than about Marc leaving Netscape/AOL…
