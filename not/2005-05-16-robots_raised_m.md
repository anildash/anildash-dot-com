Now, I’ve got a [long history](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/02/24/robots) of [loving robots](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2001/05/11/robots_bookmark), and I’m always glad to point [Andre](http://torrez.org) to another robot story that he should be aware of, so it’s with great pleasure that I call your attention to [Chris Anderson’s example](http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/05/robot_childherd.html) of how robots are raising his children.

And my sellout offer to the [evil robot alien overlords](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/07/05/alien_overlords) still stands.
