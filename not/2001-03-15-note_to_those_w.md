Note to [those](http://www.kottke.org/)[who](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/)[might](http://www.onfocus.com/) judge me harshly for some uncouth behavior in Texas: Yesterday I was *literally* Walking In Memphis, yet you have recieved no Mark Cohn MP3s via email from me. Can you be certain that [Jack](http://www.saturn.org/) would have shown the same restraint?

I think not.
