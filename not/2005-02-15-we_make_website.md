Since I didn’t design it and only helped a little bit in building it, I can give the team my unfettered praise: The [new Six Apart site](http://www.sixapart.com/) looks great. Nice work, team, and thanks for doing such a nice job on the [Professional Network](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/) that’s near and dear to my heart.
