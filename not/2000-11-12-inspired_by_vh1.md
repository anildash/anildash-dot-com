Inspired by VH-1’s umpteenth career retrospective of Michael Jackson’s videos tonight, I dug up [Bright Lights Film Journal’s review](http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/25/jackson1.html) of Michael’s videos, which also features some tangential stuff about Janet. There are a pretty fair number of factual errors, but the analysis is pretty accurate.

As I am now 25 years old, I’m at a loss to find any value for my extensive knowledge of Michael Jackson’s career. I find his transformation from biggest star in the world to walking punchline to be endlessly fascinating. Perhaps most impressive is that his talent has gone from entertaining through his music and dancing to being so bizarre that he’s almost an inadvertent performance artist.

And of course it’s really fun to hear just *how bad* his music can get. Maybe if Jeopardy ever has an all-Michael tournament I can go on and win…
