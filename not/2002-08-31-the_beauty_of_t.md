Jane advocates [improving the intelligence of the Amazon Gold Box](http://www.umamitsunami.com/essays/bezos.asp), but I say no! I *like* that it’s so random. Though it *has* been getting better, recognizing my tastes more often. Part of the fun is that I usually IM people whom I think would be interested in whatever bit of overstock idiocy Amazon is trying to foist on me. And then I can gift it to them if they’re down for the merch purch.

Cleat nailer! Give me cleat nailers for my floor, Bezos. I don’t know what exactly I’d use ’em for, but sweet black baby jesus, I need a cleat nailer in my gold box. (That’s not a euphemism.)
