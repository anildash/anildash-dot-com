What’s worse than being a whore? Being an *unoriginal* whore. Nevertheless, I have jumped onto the bandwagon with both feet and augmented the PayPal link up above (“Oh,” you think, “*that’s* what that big letter ‘P’ is!”) with an **Amazon Personalized One-Click Extortion Button™** on the sidebar there. I know who’s been good and who’s been bad, and you don’t want to come here one day and see all the purple go away, do you?

Actually, it’s more of a technology test anyway, I’m kinda curious about the whole thing. I’ve spent the better part of today donating to [Ev](http://www.evhead.com) and [Matt](http://www.metafilter.com) and [Derek](http://fray.org/cafe/postcard.html), or at least their very deserving efforts, and if my unemployed ass can do it, so can you. Go give ’em a couple of bucks.

If you’re intersted in becoming a client of mine, though, feel free to use any pay method that’s convenient…
