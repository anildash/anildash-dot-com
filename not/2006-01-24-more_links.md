Hey kids, do you like links? Me too.

- Chris Anderson revisits [the death of the blockbuster](http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/01/death_of_the_bl.html), which is of course astute and correct, but is mostly interesting to me because it mentions that Musicland is floundering. I’ve got a gleeful schadenfreude thing going here, based on the interactions I had with them in a company I worked at five years ago. It sucks to be in the music retailing business anyway, where else do you end up competing with both Apple and Starbucks?
- Reading [Hugh’s post](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/002175.html) was a much-needed reminder of why I love the communities I participate in, and not just my job. There’s been a number of profoundly unkind folks that seem to be getting my goat lately, but most people who blog are just plain good people.
- From the best of craigslist, a [love note to Muhammad Ali](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/chi/110048529.html). There’s a very rare group of people who can say “I’m the Greatest” and not just have the world agree with them, but *root* for them.
- Need a reminder? Here’s another list of [reasons why you shouldn’t buy conflict diamonds](http://www.fguide.org/Bulletin/conflictdiamonds.htm).
- Somehow I’d missed that [Cisco bought Scientific Atlanta](http://www.scientificatlanta.com/newscenter/index.htm). Does that mean that Cisco’s got more screen-connected computers in people’s homes than Dell does? Is it possible that IOS will replace OS X as the second most popular operating system for home computers?
- I’m kind of intrigued by [Kevin Burton’s smart use of the ServerBeach affiliate program](http://www.feedblog.org/2006/01/100_discount_fo.html) to help boostrap his work. Being the number one affiliate for a program is a great way to gain influence with a vendor, as well as to generate some good revenues. I’m learning a lot more about this stuff ever since we launched the biggest and best (and first?) [blog affiliate program](http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/affiliate) in the world. Sometimes it’s as much fun to do new stuff with business models as it is to do new features.
- What’s the best Web 2.0 application in the world? [iClock](http://iclock.org/)! I have a vision: An XML feed with the current time, updating once a minute.
- Alert Slashdot — there’s a geek parody site that’s actually funny! Behold [GPLv4](http://www.gplv4.org/).
- I keep seeing people taking pitctures of the [blogging delivered](http://spe.atdmt.com/ds/6AATAATTTBRA/336x280_ATT_owords_blogging_FINAL.swf) ads, and I have to admit my vision of “blogging delivered” is different. Probably something more like [this](http://dashes.com/anil/stuff/MeFiPi.jpg).
