I’ve been amused for weeks by 37signals marketing for their upcoming micro-CRM app [Highrise](http://www.highrisehq.com/) because of the example contacts they’ve been using.
[![highrise-person.png](http://www.dashes.com/anil/images/highrise-person.png)](http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/tour-person.png)

Every single screenshot has a list of contacts including the Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg, Apple’s Steve Jobs, Amazon founder (and 37signals investor) Jeff Bezos, and Newsweek scribe Steven Levy. The big product shot is a full-screen profile of Walt Mossberg that has [DHH](http://www.loudthinking.com/) reverently quoting *Wired* calling Walt a “kingmaker”. I’m sure it’s gonna be a good product, and I’ve always been alternately pleased and bemused by the swaggering chutzpah of the Chicago boy band. But the *real* lesson I’m reminded of here is that you can do a lot worse than name-dropping those whom you want to impress.

This could be considered tending to the [blank slate](http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000375.php) of press coverage.
