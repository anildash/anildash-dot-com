There’s this theory that’s been tumbling around half-formed in my brain for the past few days. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it basically has to do with the fact that two of **the most pervasively adopted trends during the 1990s** were the Internet and thong underwear on women. Both are damned near ubiquitous these days, both are suddenly common parts of our day-to-day life, and, for the record, I was an early supporter of both.

I will divine the cultural significance at some later date. [Any insights](javascript:viewComments(5421229))? ( echo commentCount(5421229); ?>)
