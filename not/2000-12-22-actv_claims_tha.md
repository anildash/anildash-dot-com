ACTV claims that Disney [stole the idea for enhanced TV from them](http://www.nypost.com/business/18583.htm). The problem is, **these guys are nuts**. I met them when they came to our office, and they seemed be genuinely 100% clueless. Best of all, once the upper-level guys left, the worker bees said that even *they* figured the "HyperTV" patent was just a plan to shake down other companies.

I hate this crap.
