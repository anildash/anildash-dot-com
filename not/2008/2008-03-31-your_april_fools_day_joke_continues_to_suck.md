Having been blogging for a few years, I’ve developed a few annual traditions. This one’s a favorite: Warning you off of lame April Fool’s jokes on the web. Every year, I get called a curmudgeon, or lambasted for having no sense of humor. And every year, the jokes online get lamer and lamer.

I’d mentioned that [Your April Fool’s Day Joke Sucks](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/03/your-april-fool.html) two years ago, revisited the idea [last year](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/your-april-fool-1.html), and have been proud to have been joined in my assessment by luminaries such as [Joshua Schachter](http://joshua.schachter.org/2008/03/stupid-internet-joke-day.html) and [Andy Baio](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2006/03/31/internet.shtml) in taking a critical eye at this sort of thing.

The exception, of course, is if you’re doing something truly hysterical or on a magnificent scale. But I fear we won’t run into too many of those.
