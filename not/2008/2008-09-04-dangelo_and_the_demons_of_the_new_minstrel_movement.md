Spin Magazine’s piece covering the [rise and fall, and perhaps second rise](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ul7jcf4HvN4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false) of D’Angelo has been lingering in my mind for weeks. As you might expect, I was a fan of D’Angelo’s from the start.

And that’s true even though I was [clowning him](/2005/01/darrested) when he got arrested. To tell the truth, I hadn’t quite realized just how far the man had fallen. If you look at [the comments](/2005/01/darrested#comments) on my post from three years ago, you can see that even *then* people were saying they just wanted the man to get well so they could hear more of his work. ?uestlove articulates the challenge here better than anyone, though: “The new minstrel movement in hip-hop doesn’t allow the audience to believe the artist is smart.”

It’s a particularly striking observation given that Spin’s look at D’Angelo mentions in passing how that tension between art and commerce has affected *so many* of the acts I love. The world of R&B success demands either heaven or hell — you either become a preacher and lose all of the sexiness and swagger that made you compelling in the first place. Or worse, you succumb to the demons.

> While D’Angelo grew increasingly isolated, the rocky path he was traveling was, ironically enough, quite crowded with like-minded compatriots. At least three of neo-soul’s other late’90s leading lights — Maxwell, [Erykah] Badu, and [Lauryn] Hill — have spent much of the new millennium on the sidelines.
> 
> Hill’s struggles have been well documented: She followed her 1998 breakthrough, *The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill*, with an *MTV Unplugged* set four years later that felt like the soundtrack to a real-time nervous breakdown. She’s yet to offer a second studio album and, apart from some aborted Fugees reunions, occassional shows, and involvement with a shady guru, much of her time has apparently been devoted to her family.
> 
> Badu released her triple-platinum debut, *Baduizm*, in 1997 and a successful follow-up, *Mama’s Gun*, three years later, and then said she had writer’s block and went on what she dubbed “The Frustrated Artist Tour” in search of inspiration. She eked out a slight EP in 2003 but then was largely silent, until the well-received release of *New AmErkykah (Pt. 1 4th World War)* last February.
> 
> Maxwell’s journey probably parallels D’Angelo’s most closely. The Brooklyn-born singer released three platinum albums between 1996 and 2001, earning frequent comparisons to D’Angelo, then seemed to disappear entirely. A new album, *Black Summers’ Night*, was originally slated for spring 2004 but has been delayed repeatedly. Some close to him suggest that, like D’Angelo, he’s been wrestling with a rather ill-fitting public image as a sex god.

There’s much, much more in the story, but it’s almost impossible to overstate how much a lot of us had put our faith for the future of soul music in a small group of talented artists. A decade later, it almost seems as if no one’s even *trying* to carry the torch anymore.

We’ll see how it goes; I’ve got tickets to see Maxwell in concert next month, and I’m still holding out for that new D’Angelo record.
