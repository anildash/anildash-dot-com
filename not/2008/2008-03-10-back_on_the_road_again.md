Blogging’s been light because this part of March is the heart of the conference season for me, usually stretching for a few exhausting weeks on the road. My new goal this year was to take it a little easier, pace myself better, get more sleep and exercise, and then try to make the things I *do* participate in get enough focus that they’re done well.

That seems to be working out, especially as I come back to [SXSW](http://www.sxsw.com/) for the first time in years. Some nice mentions in [Wired talking about my Battledecks presentation](http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/sxsw-fun-with-p.html) (see also a [video clip](http://rooreynolds.com/2008/03/07/sxsw-day-1-battledecks/) which captures most of the presentation), both [Valleywag](http://valleywag.com/365529/sxsws-a-real-kick) and [CNet](http://www.news.com/8301-13772_3-9889244-52.html) talking about this year’s amazingly-successful [kickball game](http://dashes.com/kick/), and a [really](http://tweetscan.com/index.php?s=anildash&amp;u=)[amusing](http://tweetscan.com/index.php?s=anil+dash&amp;u=) bunch of conversations on Twitter that show just how much people like a pithy soundbite when participating in a panel. It’s been fun seeing everybody in person, but I can’t say I’m not ready to go home.
