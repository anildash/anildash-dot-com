I forgot to mention one point when I was [blathering about lists](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2008/07/lists-and-being-on-them.html) earlier this week: The easiest way to get on them is by asserting, truthfully or not, that you don’t want to be on them.

Behold, my [incredible mancrushworthiness](http://www.urlesque.com/2008/07/23/blogger-mancrush-anil-dash/), from an [entire list](http://www.urlesque.com/2008/07/23/20-bloggers-on-whom-were-mancrushin/) of the mancrush-worthy. Or something.

It’s nice to be called nice, but it’s even better that people wrongly believe that I *am* nice. Thanks, Eliot!
