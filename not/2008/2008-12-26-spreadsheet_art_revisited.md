One of my recurring fascinations is people creating works of art using common productivity software. [Office Tools of Expression](http://dashes.com/anil/2007/08/office-tools-of-expression.html) as a review of this medium that I wrote last year, and [Excel Pile](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/04/excel-pile.html) offered an overview back in 2004.

Today, the idea of using office software as a means of expression is popping up more and more frequently. Danielle Aubert released [16 Months Worth of Drawing Exercises in Microsoft Excel](http://www.projectno8.com/danielle.html) about two years ago, as a fifty-dollar coffee table book offering exactly what the title suggests. [Writer Response Theory](http://writerresponsetheory.org/wordpress/2006/12/11/excel-and-artbooks/) presented a terrific overview of the work at the time, as well as an [interview with Aubert](http://writerresponsetheory.org/wordpress/2006/12/15/excelling-an-interview-with-danielle-aubert/):

> I started making Excel drawings, never spending more than 30-40 minutes on each one, and I tried not to get hung up on whether I was making non-representational versus representational versus abstract versus systems versus typographic drawings. I just made drawings about anything that I thought might be pleasing in some general way. After a while I started to copy one day’s drawing into a spreadsheet for the next day’s drawing because I found that that way the drawings could build on themselves and maybe become a bit more complex. But really my main objective when I began making them was to experiment with making ’small art’ – or the equivalent of my friend’s small poems – in Excel.

And then, for the holidays this year, the Google Docs team has gotten into the game. They’ve released “Collaborative Spreadsheet Art”, a winter-themed piece created by four artists working simultaneously in the web-based spreadsheet app. The introductory movie is only a minute long.

The [Google Docs holiday site](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/holiday08.html) offers more insights into the creation of the work, including a look [behind the scenes](http://www.google.com/google-d-s/holiday08_bts.html). Now I’m just waiting for the various web-based art programs to make performance videos of people using their tools to do calculations and analyze data.

If you’re really taken with this stuff, my [earlier post](http://dashes.com/anil/2007/08/office-tools-of-expression.html) gathers up a list of interesting links about office app art.
