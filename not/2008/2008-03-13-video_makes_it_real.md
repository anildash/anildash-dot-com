After all of the fun with the Snoop Dogg video a little while back, I figured I’d include some videos that are a bit closer to home, both from this past weekend’s SXSW interactive festival.

First, [Rocketboom captured the Battledecks competition](http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/rb_08_mar_13), where I was thrilled to have shared the stage with a number of really funny people in trying to improvise a presentation in front of slides we’d never seen before.

Then, the following day, [Mike Pusateri recorded a time lapse](http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001490.html) of the [kickball game](__GHOST_URL__/kick/).

I especially love the taco break there in the middle, when everyone runs to go eat breakfast tacos. Yum!
