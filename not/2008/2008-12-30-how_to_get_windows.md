If you’d like to open up the package for your licensed copy of Microsoft Windows Vista, you only need to follow [these three helpfully-illustrated steps](http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/2e680b8d-211e-41c5-a0bf-9ccc6d7e62a21033.mspx).

“The Windows Vista box opens with a swing-out section that holds your DVD and manuals. The box has two security seals that need to be cut or removed before it can be opened.” The first time I opened a copy of Windows Vista Ultimate, it took me a solid 5 minutes to figure out how to do it without breaking the box.
