As always, I am trying to be everywhere at once. Here’s where I’ve succeeded:

- Dan Costa at PC Magazine offers a [look at the rise of micro social networks](http://www.pcmag.com/print_article2/0,1217,a%253D232053,00.asp). I get a nod there, but it’s more satisfying to see the idea itself take off. That’s an idea that [Chris](http://www.r21.org/) and I revisited at the [BlogWorld](http://www.blogworldexpo.com/) conference last week, along with a discussion of [blogging becoming an industry](http://videos.webpronews.com/2008/09/29/blogworld-blogging-becoming-an-industry/).
- There’s a pleasantly inexplicable [passing mention of me](http://blog.internetnews.com/kcorbin/2008/09/silicon-alley-no-more.html) in reference to the Web 2.0 Expo here in New York. In case it’s not been clear in the past, I am *delighted* that the tech industry in NYC is closely linked to other industries like media and finance. It gives us a useful perspective and makes tech companies in NYC wiser and less prone to falling into the echo chamber that frustrates me about a lot of Silicon Valley companies. And I never liked the name “Silicon Alley” anyway.
- The South Asian Journalists Association invited me to participate in the [first of two conversations about the South Asian blogging community](http://www.sajaforum.org/2008/09/webcast-the-sou.html). I thought a lot of the points raised were pretty interesteing, and am a big fan of the [SAJA blog](http://www.sajaforum.org/), so this was a lot of fun.
- The less said about [this](http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2008/09/anil-dash-remixes-the-freeconferencecallcom-hold-music.html), the better. I’m looking at you, [Andy](http://www.buzzfeed.com/yacomink/hold-music-remix-v).
