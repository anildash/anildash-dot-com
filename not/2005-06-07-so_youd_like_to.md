I’ve been on a big “there’s nothing new under the sun” kick lately, so let’s take a look at [Infoseek’s sitelist.txt proposal](http://web.archive.org/web/19970529104229/http:/software.infoseek.com/products/ultraseek/docs/sitelist.html) from 1997, and [deepleap.xml](http://static.userland.com/gems/eclectic/deepleap.xml), from DeepLeap back in 2000. Or hey, there’s HTML’s [LINK](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.1.2), which lets you describe relationships that can encompass a lot of a site’s content. And hey, there might even be formats for describing a feed of a site’s content and when it gets updated.
