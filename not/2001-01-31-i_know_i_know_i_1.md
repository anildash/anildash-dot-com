I know, I know, I’ve linked to [explodingdog](http://explodingdog.com/) before. Multiple times. But there is something **so profound and evocative** about these drawings that I just can’t resist… I want these pictures everywhere. If I ever grow up and have a house or an apartment, this is the art I want to have on the walls. I want to someday do something that expresses an idea and communicates a feeling as well as sam seems to do every day…

These drawings make me happy.
