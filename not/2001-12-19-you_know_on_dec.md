You know, on [December 11th](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2001_12_01_archive.php#7828156), I almost posted an “all-clear” notice, that it had been three months and the rest of the world could go back to hating New York City again. But then I decided that perhaps my sense of humor is too dark and there was really no need for such negativity.

As it turns out, [I needn’t have worried](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/13194#191966), **the whining has returned**. But fuck the playa haters anyway. We’ll kick all their asses. One of my favorite examples of why I love this town is the street signs; our street signs don’t mess around. Where a mere “No Parking” would suffice in a lesser city, ours say “Don’t Even *Think* About Parking Here”. “Quiet Please” becomes “Honk and You Will Be Fined $300”. I’ve seen *stop signs* in the outer boroughs that have “This Means You” appended to them.

But the other day I found the zenith of NYC signage. A simple appeal for park visitors to curb their dogs, filtered through the native penchant for attitude and an intrinsic elitism, yields a moral judgement on the competence and fitness of the human reading the sign:

![NYC Parks Dep't Sign: If You're Not Responsible Enough To Clean Up After Your Dog, You Don't Deserve To Own One.](__GHOST_URL__/anil/stuff/scolding.jpg)

I bet they don’t have *those* in Seattle, [Adam](http://www.metafilter.com/user.mefi/7883). You got a problem with that?
