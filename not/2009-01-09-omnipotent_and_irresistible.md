> [T]he burger is omnipotent and irresistible. It can never be weakened. It can never be slowed down. It can never stop its ever-increasing growth in popularity. It’s the single most powerful force in the food universe…. The hamburger is a way that people can experience everything that’s great about eating beef—the flavor, the tenderness, and everything—in a way that’s a affordable.

That’s Josh Ozersky, quoted over on [A Hamburger Today](http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/01/josh-ozersky-hamburgers-nightline-la-frieda-black-label-burger-boom.html), from his appearance on Nightline. The great thing about the fact that I’ve been blogging for almost ten years is that I can definitively prove that I was [blogging](http://www.dashes.com/anil/1999/09/reilly-burger.html)[about burgers](http://dashes.com/anil/1999/10/a-reply-from-sh.html) before it was cool. The second great thing is that I am sitting at my desk at work, and the Shake Shack is only a stone’s throw away.
