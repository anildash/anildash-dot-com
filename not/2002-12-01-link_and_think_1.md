In keeping with the community nature of the observance, the best links about today’s [Link and Think](http://linkandthink.org/) event in honor of World AIDS Day are at [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/), the community weblog. Also, [last year’s Link and Think page](http://www.metafilter.com/linkandthink.mefi) is still a remarkable record of the weblog community’s breadth and depth of knowledge and emotion on the subject.
