And now for a bit of time travel: There was a high school in Mississippi that used to have two separate homecoming elections, with two kings and two queens. The reason? Well, they had one for white kids and one for black kids. Besides my own obvious take on it, (“Umm, how does a brown guy become homecoming queen then?”) I think most sensible humans find this sort of thing pretty revolting. The good news is, they of course reversed this backwards policy and combined the two elections into one, presumably race-neutral, homecoming election.

Oh, and the time travel part? They reversed the policy [*last week*](http://www.gomemphis.com/mca/local_news/article/0,1426,MCA_437_837605,00.html). How progressive!
