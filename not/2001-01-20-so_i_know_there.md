So I know there’s some reason this shouldn’t be done, but I can’t think of it right now… Why can’t we make parents whose children are convicted of a crime (or maybe even whose children fail in school) pay higher taxes? It’s virtually guaranteed that their children will cause a higher burden on society, let’s do the same cost/benefit thing with our tax dollars that conservatives are so fond of and take it to its logical extreme.

I’ll have to think about this more.
