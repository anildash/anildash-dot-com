[Peter](http://www.peterme.com/)‘s got a cogent, well-written thoughtwander about the confluence of the many different information-organization and presentation disciplines all converging into a new class of web creation jobs.

But of course, my main focus, as ever, is me me me, so the quote that most stood out was this:

> [W]e need to draw from backgrounds as varied as can be. The Web has created a space for a uniquely synthetic type of design, and a need for processes to address this.

> **It’s also calling for generalists to lead project teams.**

(Emphasis added.) More Big Thoughts for me to process…
