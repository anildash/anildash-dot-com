**Agh**. Much sorriness to all of you, I have not dropped off the face of the web, nor am I ignoring your emails, but my little notebook from which I run most of this site is now…. sob, sob…. **dead**.

I don’t have much chance at work to upkeep but that should change in the next few days. Please be patient with the emails! Thanks!

Until then, reflect on this: We used [Priceline](http://www.priceline.com) to buy our groceries. At the store, it rang up as **$92**. And we had paid **$42**. Absolute truth, totally unsolicited testimonial.
