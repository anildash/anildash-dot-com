eBay’s just launched [eBay Pulse](http://pulse.ebay.com/), kinda similar to Google’s Zeitgeist, but listing what particular kinds of crap eBay buyers are inflicting on their loved ones this holiday season.

There’s also some nice looks at the highest priced and most watched items. A good starting point for journalists to peg their trend-watching stories on.
