Umm, to everyone forwarding me the MP3 of the prank call to the Village Voice about placing a personal ad, thanks, but [I got it](?fram.php). Since I work at the Village Voice, everyone and his brother thinks I ought to get a copy. You’ve probably seen it under the name “budonkadonk.mp3”. Yes, it was an actual prank call. It was placed by Tracy Morgan. (Whom I actually coincidentally met last week. Strange.) With kind permission of the sweet woman who answered the phone, the Voice legal team cleared it for air on the Comedy Central show [Crank Yankers](http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/crankyankers/). No word yet on how the bit leaked out, but I’m guessing it must’ve been through the company that was doing the lip-sync puppetry for the show.

I got it from [the Turbanhead crew](http://turbanhead.com). Heh.
