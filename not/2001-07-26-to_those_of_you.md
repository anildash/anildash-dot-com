To those of you still unemployed, please keep your hopes up. And take some satisfaction in knowing that employment, even with a job like the one I was fortunate enough to get, **has its drawbacks**: I got a call right before leaving for work today, offering me free tickets to this afternoon’s Yankees game.

And I couldn’t go.
