Here at the [Voice on the Net conference](http://192.246.69.114/von/Spring03/), I just attended a panel by [Doc](http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/04/01#decentralities), [David](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000268.html) and [Duncan](http://www.pulver.com/von/schedule_bws91042117273.html#bwkd1045666574), which [Kevin](http://werbach.com/blog/2003/03/30.html#a986) moderated. The topic was decentralization, and the panel acted (at least to me) like a movie trailer for the full-length release of the next [Supernova](http://www.pulver.com/supernova/) conference in DC later this year.

Though I was a bit out of my league (I’m not very literate in the Voice over IP realm) yesterday during the vendor discussions, today’s bevy of panels have been a bit more within my range of expertise and so I enjoyed them quite a bit more.

Any of you attending the conference can stop by [the Introduction to Blogging panel](http://www.von.com/schedule.html) I’m participating in tomorrow. Though if you’re reading this site right now, you probably don’t *need* an introduction…
