This is a partial list of great dogs I have known over the years, in vaguely chronological order.

- Ooloo Nanda
- Max Dash
- Snowball Buyakowski
- Reba Smith
- Bubba/Baba Dash
- that cute one with the underbite, whose name I don’t remember
- Cosmo Belle Smith
- Chelsie Belle Browne

My dog Max, who we had when I was a kid, turns out to have had a name that sounds like a porn star. I didn’t realize that at the time. Of course, I was only 8. When my mom was younger, they had a dog named Laika, after the cosmonaut-dog.

Feel free to submit names of dogs you have loved. The more baroque, the better.
