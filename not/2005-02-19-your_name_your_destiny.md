One of the great revelations of [this AP story on Kevin Federline](http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/0214kevin.html) is that Kevin’s second child with Shar Jackson is named "Kaleb Michael Jackson Federline".

Now, it’s possible, given that Shar’s last name is Jackson, that the young boy is named Kaleb Michael Jackson-Federline. But I strongly prefer to think that Britney Spears has a stepson named Kaleb *Michael Jackson* Federline.

Because you can’t have enough [weird Michael Jackson-related kids’ names](http://dashes.com/anil/2002/08/the-once-and-fu.html). And as a bonus, if you write about weird Michael Jackson-related kids’ names, you get [comments from crazy people](http://www.consolationchamps.com/archives/000659.html).

Heal the World, y’all. Heal the World.
