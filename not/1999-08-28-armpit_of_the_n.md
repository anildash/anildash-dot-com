While traveling back to Pennsylvania today, I had occasion to reflect on a **recurrent observation of New Jersey** that I have every time I go through the state. While I’ve long referred to Jersey as "**The Armpit of Our Nation**", it occurs to me that it’s not only a **polluted, run-down collection of traffic circles and strip malls**, it boasts another unique distinction:

**New Jersey is the only state so bad, neighboring states can actually *charge admission*.**

**Need Proof?** Take the George Washington Bridge, from Jersey to Manhattan. Toll to travel to New York: $4.00. Toll to travel from New York to Jersey: **$0.00**.

**Need another example?** Interstate 78. Traveling across the Delaware River from Pennsylvania to New Jersey: No toll. From Jersey to Pennsylvania? You guessed it, a toll: fifty cents.

Garden State, my ass…
