If you’re in New York City and you’ve got time tonight, please do come by and check out the [Ecommerce SIG](http://ecommercesig.com/)‘s panel discussion on "Intro to Business Blogs". We’ve got a great roster of speakers, it’s easy to get to at IBM’s midtown offices, and we’re hoping to have some real, useful information about weblogs for businesses. No philosophical debates, just practical implementation details, examples of people using the technology, and a good chance to network.
