I will just give you the links:

[PHP code](http://toys.incutio.com/php/php-google-web-api.html) to access the [Google API](http://google.com/apis/). Incidentally, [WSDL](http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl) is amazing. And, in keeping with the programmer’s rule that laziness is rewarded, I have no incentive to finish my Word-to-BloggerAPI interface because, of course, [it’s been done](http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/stories/2002/04/11/radioBloggingFromWord.html).

[My rant](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/mefi/2085#33658) against the insecurity that makes people want to compare weblogs to journalism, inspired by [John Hiler’s ruminations](http://www.microcontentnews.com/articles/bloggingjournalism.htm) about a weblogging code of ethics and weblogs as (sigh.) journalism.

[Sparring with Monique](http://www.hideouskinky.net/blogmt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=39) about people’s willingness to accept shit and call it a weblog, prompted by her [anti-elitism rant](http://www.hideouskinky.net/archives/000039.html#000039). I want to call bullshit on the people who make crap.

[Un reconocimiento peque�ito](http://www.tremendo.com/bitacora/archivo/?4/9/2002_75190372) for the Dvorak thread, which I got bored with last week, but I am still kind of amused by my [response](http://discuss.pcmag.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=pcmag&amp;msg=6116.23) to his original article. (Secret confession: I like John, and agree with most of his points.)

I want to help Cory [kill NetSol](http://boingboing.net/2002_04_01_archive.html#85002203).

Macromedia’s [John Dowdell](http://jdmx.blogspot.com/) ruminates on their MX tools platform. A different vision than mine, but an excellent implementation of that vision.

When Heather launched her [new design](http://www.harrumph.com/020407.shtml) I tried recreating it in XHTML/CSS, just as an exercise. Compare the source of her page to [this version](stuff/heather.html) to see one way it could be done.

Bouncing ideas from [Steve](http://snarkout.org) to [Meg](http://www.megnut.com/) makes me smarter.

[Damien got excited](http://www.mrbarrett.com/mt/archives/2002_04_11.html#000197), like I am, about the potential of wirelessness. So we clarified Bluetooth’s strengths and weaknesses against [Wi-Fi](http://www.mrbarrett.com/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=197).

Several people linked to [OJR’s discussion](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/business/1017788129.php) of how the [Wall Street Journal](http://wsj.com)wasted spent almost $30 million on their redesign. But it was [Rafe](http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=3933)‘s mention of it that made me remember that an [almost identical article](http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:r_Jiwf_jlOEC:ojr.usc.edu/content/story.cfm%3FID%3D691+down+to+the+trademark+miniature+diamonds+used+in+the+layout&amp;hl=en) at the end of January. Rafe also [mentioned](http://rc3.org/cgi-bin/less.pl?arg=3918) a [despicable, sniveling, sorry excuse for a "businessman"](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/04/04/aquatic_plants/index.html?CP=RDF&amp;DN=310) who sued people for criticizing his company. The part that galled me about the article was that this guy expanded his charges and went after his targets more vehemently by a series of actions that included filing new claims against one of the people on September 15. This, from a person who lives on Long Island, less than an hour’s drive from Manhattan. Seems to me actual humans were busier with other things that week.

And then, for work, I discovered [News Industry Text Format](http://www.nitf.org/).

There’s more, I’ll get to that later.
