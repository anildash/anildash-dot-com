With the announcement of the [New York Sun](http://www.newyorksun.com/) launching its daily broadsheet into an already-overcrowded market, parroting the same few news stories ad nauseum, it occurs to me that maybe I should revise my position a bit. When considered in the context of the New York press, with its [pointless](http://wsj.com)[redesigns](http://nytimes.com), [shameless right-wing trolling](http://www.nypost.com), and [endless hand-wringing liberal bellyaching](http://villagevoice.com), I can’t help but think it’s true: Weblogs *are* journalism.
