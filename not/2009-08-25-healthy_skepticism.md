I’ve been putting a lot of speculative ideas out lately; It’s nice to see some healthy (and respectful) criticism from people who are skeptical about what I’m saying.

Gautham Nagesh [followed up on](http://www.gnagesh.com/2009/08/twitterversy-skeptic-or-realist.html) my [earlier post](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/08/continuing-the-conversation.html) and fairly criticized the recent government websites I praised as being too tentative and unproven to merit the praise I’d given them. Interestingly, I had a throwaway half-sentence saying “I think Gautham and I just disagree about government’s role in general”, and Gautham interpreted this as a bit of an attack on his journalistic integrity, by implying that he wasn’t being impartial about the story. That certainly wasn’t my intention, but more importantly I think I just forgot (being a blogger myself) that Serious Journalists still care a whole lot about that idea. For what it’s worth, I think it’s great when journalists have a clearly disclosed partiality about a story.

Similarly, Mitch Wagner talked about my post a bit on InformationWeek’s Government Blog, saying I’m “[being excessively optimistic, because the Obama White House’s record on transparency is decidedly mixed at best, as noted by the Washington Post in a May editorial.](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/08/us_government_g.html)” A fair criticism, though I think I was highlighting these recent efforts by the government as signals of intent to use the web well, rather than declaring Mission Accomplished. Hence, most *interesting* startup of 2009, not most *successful*. I went into this a bit further in this [interview I did with Maggie Shiels](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/08/the_new_tech_startup_the_us_government.html) for the BBC’s tech blog:

> “I am not a Polyanna about this, ” Mr Dash told me.
> 
> “I don’t think necessarily everything that comes out of this will be immediately great. It will take people some time to understand the potential there is for something great to happen.

On a less critical note, I did like that [Inc’s take on my post](http://blog.inc.com/archives/2009/08/the_most_intere.html) mentioned the success that private companies have had with similar API and data efforts; That was an analogy I should have made more explicitly and prominently in my own post.
