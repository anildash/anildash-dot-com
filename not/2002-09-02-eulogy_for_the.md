Over at Starmama’s, a [eulogy for the sidin’ scene](http://www.ofrenda.org/starmama/archive/000821.html), mourning the passing so eloquently that you feel like you were there yourself. Exceptional writing about the kind of moment in time that we only ever get to hear about from people who weren’t there.
