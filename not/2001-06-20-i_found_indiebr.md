I found [Indiebride](http://www.indiebride.com/) the other day, and it appealed to me with the simple statement of its self-stated niche:

> [A] place for would-be brides who have more on their minds than planning a reception, women who never for a second believed in Prince Charming and who have not, despite all of the cultural cues, been breathlessly awaiting their wedding day for their whole life.

I think it’s a shame that getting “weddinged” has taken such a priority over getting *married* for a lot of people. Of course, it’s the money in the elaborate, “traditional” wedding industry that compels businesses to perpetuate the existing trends. I scare-quote the word traditional because, well, *some* of us have slightly different traditions.

A fact which [some](http://www.brides.com/)[magazines](http://www.modernbride.com/) would probably like to forget…
