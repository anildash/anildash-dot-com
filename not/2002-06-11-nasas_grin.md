[GRIN](http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/): Great Images in NASA, a library of spectacular photography, courtesy of our space program. Don’t let the people who support NASA on military grounds see this site, or they’ll think they’re funding an arts program and kill it.

A great example is this shot of [the Earth with the Moon peeking out behind it](http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-001437.html), with South America in the foreground. We’ve got a great little planet here, methinks.
