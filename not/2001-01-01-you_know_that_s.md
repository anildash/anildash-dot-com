You know that saying, "Fool me once, shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me"? Well, what if someone keeps fooling me over and over, and I know they’re going to do it, and I keep waiting for Lucy to pull the football away just as I start to kick?

I mean, I know I am to blame for falling for it, and I’ll take that responsibility. But dammit, why doesn’t anyone go over there and kick Lucy’s ass for being such a mean, selfish bitch?

I’m just wondering.
