Alright, kids, if you’re headed to Texas for [South by Southwest Interactive](http://www.sxsw.com/interactive), you’d damn well better come to [KICK!](http://www.dashes.com/kick/)

KICK! is the annual kickball game on Saturday morning that’s used as an unofficial, unsanctioned, and unpretentious introduction to the whole weekend. Everyone’s welcome, nobody gets picked last, and attending is free. If you’re not busy Saturday morning, please come out and join us, and whether you’re going to be there or not, it’d be a great help if you can promote the game by linking to the KICK! page.
