I’ve got a question that’s been banging around in my brain for ages now. I’ve seen [Melanie Griffith](http://www.melaniegriffith.com/splash.html)‘s site linked all over the place, even by people whose work and thoughts I respect. Perhaps I was absent the day they handed out the practical joke instructions, but aren’t all you people aware that she’s stupid? Hell, she’s a quarter past stupid and about 5 minutes until moron.

No, no, of course I haven’t personally met her. But I’ve seen her movies and heard her talk. And the only person I know who *has* met her confirms my suspicions.

So stop it. Either everyone stop linking to her, or somebody explain the joke to me. Because it’s not funny, and I’m getting quite upset. Melanie Griffith is gross.
