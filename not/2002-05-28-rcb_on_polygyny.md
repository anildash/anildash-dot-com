RCB has written an illuminating [essay on polygyny](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2002/05.html#26polygyny), it’s a terrific read. She had given me a briefer version of these thoughts this weekend, but seeing the breadth and depth of her references and research just makes this all so much more compelling to read and ponder.

Of course, after she finished her extraordinarily literate dissertation on the implications of polygynous lifestyles on women, I responded with a lame wink-wink joke about having multiple wives. Because I’m an intellectual like that. Next up? Armpit noises.
