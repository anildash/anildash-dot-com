Just a note for those who’ve emailed, I’m travelling this week and busy with other work stuff, so the Daily Links will continue to be light or nonexistent, and postings here will be as infrequent as they tend to be of late. Thanks for your patience, and why don’t you while away the extra hours by visiting [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/) and admiring our beautiful Five Days of TypePad screenshots?
