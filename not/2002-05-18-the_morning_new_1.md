After Andy shut down [Lines & Splines](http://www.linesandsplines.com/), I was afraid we wouldn’t get great work like his [review of the typography](http://www.linesandsplines.com/2002_04_01_archive.html#75586699) of the Wall Street Journal redesign. I needn’t have worried; He pops up over at The Morning News with “[Typography in *The Sun*](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/new_york_new_york/typography_in_the_sun.shtml)“.
