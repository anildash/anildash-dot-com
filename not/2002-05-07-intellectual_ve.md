I had been wondering for a while what Nathan Myhrvold’s company [Intellectual Ventures](http://www.intellectualventures.com/home/default.asp) was up to. MIT’s [Technology Review](http://www.technologyreview.com/)[spills the beans](http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/schwartz0502.asp). It appears to be a patent-oriented think tank, focused on inventors who have a track record of cashing in on their inventions.

I wanna work there.
