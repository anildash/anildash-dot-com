… let’s hear more about me! I had the chance a few weeks ago to do be [interviewed by Leah Peterson](http://leahpeah.com/blog/interviews/anil-dash). It was a nice chance to talk about some things that I don’t usually blog about, and if you’re interested in more, Leah has a whole [series of interviews](http://leahpeah.com/blog/posts/category/interviews/) on her blog that I found pretty interesting.

As a special bonus, there’s a goofy picture of me at the top of the interview from when I was [speaking](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/9526) at the [O’Reilly Open Source Convention](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/) back in July.
