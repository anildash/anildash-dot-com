Sure, everybody’s linking to Ironic Sans’ (admittedly entertaining) [Celebrity Patents](http://www.ironicsans.com/2007/01/celebrity_patents.html), since [Waxy](http://waxy.org/links/) pointed them out, but did you know Prince actually has a *real* patent?
[Patent D349127](http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPATD349127&amp;id=-F8oAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=prince+rogers+nelson) is for a portable electronic keyboard musical instrument. But Prince prefers to call the monstrosity the Purpleaxxe™.

It’s a horrible 80s-style keytar, though it wasn’t created or actively used until well into the 90s. Prince, of course, didn’t inflict the ungainly shoulder-mounted funk launcher on his own frame — he made his then-keyboardist Tommy Elm play it. But no, this sort of humiliation wasn’t enough for Prince to inflict on the young man, he also renamed the poor fellow Tommy Barbarella, after — you guessed it! — the 1968 Jane Fonda sci-fi cheesecake flick. As you might guess, it’s one of Prince’s favorite movies.

Though the Purpleaxxe™ has fallen into disuse in the interceding decade and a half, Elm is [still saddled](http://www.tommybarbarella.com/) with his unfortunate sobriquet (joining such stalwart Prince-named talents as [Carmen Electra](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/04/16/cereal_boxes_li)). And you can find mention of the Purpleaxxe™ in various liner notes on Prince’s albums, as well as the lyrics to a b-side remix on an out-of-print CD single from 1992. You know, if you’re in to that sort of thing.
