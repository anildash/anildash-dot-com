This [commentary on OS X and Darwin](http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/comment/0,5859,2657124,00.html) isn’t really notable except for this one excerpt:

> The usual suspects on various weblogs would rather idolize OS X and kvetch about whether it’s the victim of FUD (without providing any references to the FUDful stories complained about) than boost the real underdog, the open source effort behind Darwin.

Significant because it marks **the first time I’ve ever seen the world "weblog" in casual usage** in an industry article that *wasn’t* about blogs.
