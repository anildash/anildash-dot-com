I suppose it’s fitting that [Caterina illustrates so well](http://www.caterina.net/2001_06_01_archive.html#4137012) a point I’ve been trying to make for ages. Because a guy like me is sometimes afraid to say it. Nevertheless, I am convinced I will reclaim my romantic nature.

Eventually.

How do you recover from those experiences that make you want to withdraw? [I’m curious](javascript:viewComments(4144160)). ( echo commentCount(4144160); ?>)
