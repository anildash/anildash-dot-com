**Canadians are *not* evil.** To atone for my transgressions against our neighbors to the north, I have compiled some reasons why they’re not so bad, after all. First, canadian chicks saying "aboot" instead of about. How cute is this? Definitely first on my list, very swoon-worthy. Also, good fishing up that way, from what I understand.

They are good to their Native people up there, at least better than we are in the U.S. ("If you’re not Inuit, they’re you’re not having Nunavut!") Also, [Jish](http://www.jish.nu), who’s no longer even *in* the country, but still gets awards for being a Canadian blogger. And finally, Canadian Bacon.

There, now I don’t have to fear Maple Leaf terrorists coming to get me.
