Anyone want a quickie freelance web design job? Just need to spit out some PhotoShop/ImageReady files and a little basic HTML wrapped around it. No back-end stuff at all… [Drop me a note](mailto:anil@dashes.com). This would be perfect if you know someone who’s got visual design chops but is just starting out…
