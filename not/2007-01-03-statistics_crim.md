There’s a fascinating conversation taking place across a couple of blogs, which [Steven’s post on leaving Brooklyn](http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2007/01/on_leaving_broo.html) alterted me to. [Douglas Rushkoff was mugged](http://www.rushkoff.com/2006/12/merry-christmas-gimme-your-money.php) on Christmas Eve, and his wife Barbara [blogged at length](http://babble.com/CS/blogs/girlgrowsinbrooklyn/archive/2006/12/25/i-may-need-to-re-name-this-blog.aspx) about her feelings at the time. (In short, “Screw this, we’re leaving.”)

But what’s remarkable is that the entire conversation is happening so publicly. All of these people are semi-public, thanks to the work and writing that they do, but any of us can participate in the conversation. Somewhat predictably, the debate has essentially devolved into statistics and measurements being weighed against feelings and emotions.

I get defensive every time I see someone make the opposite move that I would, but in this case I was able to temper that by seeing the actual thoughts of people going through something terrifying and remarkable.
