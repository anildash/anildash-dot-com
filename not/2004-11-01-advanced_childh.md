There’s lots of business books that say we should learn from the wisdom of children, and I completely agree. During meetings, you may find the following two phrases useful.

“**Not it!**” This is good for shirking responsibility. Sample usage:

> **Big Boss:** “We need to see a report summarizing this quarter’s trends in the follow geographic regions…”
> 
> **You:** “Not it!”

“**Shotgun!**” Similarly, you may wish to express strong agreement with a sentiment, or that you’re willing to go along with a suggestion that’s been made. You’re along for the ride.

> **HR Director:** “We are strongly advocating that casual Fridays be extended to accommodate employees who elect to go pantsless.”
> 
> **You:** “Shotgun!”
