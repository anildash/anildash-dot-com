More discussion on [weblogs vs. journalism](http://www.kottke.org/cgi-bin/comments/display.pl?threadid=17#485) over at Jason’s site, but that topic bores me. More interesting is where the content and networked nature of weblogs will evolve to. Journalism, by its nature, cannot be collaboratively filtered except at the subconscious sense, of people being influenced by the prevailing zeitgeist. And it is entirely lacking in the serendipity that is intrinsic to the best weblogs.

I’ve had a concept (I first called it a microcontent browser, then a “Thing” or a Google Complement… I’m still unsure on nomenclature.) of the software system that will bookend the user experience that starts with a Google search. The ideal name for a personalized, collaboratively filtered, pervasively hyperlinked microcontent aggregator would be, in my ideal world, an Internet Explorer.

I wonder if that name’s taken.
