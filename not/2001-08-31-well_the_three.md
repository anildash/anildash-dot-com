Well, the three of you who use Netscape 4 will have noticed, and the might be interested to know, I’ve got a [new design](ns4.php) up for those of you still using old, decrepit, pathetic browsers. The beautiful design, quite different from my own, is expertly designed and rendered by [Saima](http://www.saimasays.com). She sent me the design a long time ago, I just regret that it took so long to do it justice.

If you like it, email Saima and let her know. If you hate it, it’s probably my fault.
