There is some amusing human nature conclusion that I’m sure can be drawn from the number of emails, phone calls, and instant messages I’ve gotten about my anti-obtusity comments [earlier](http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?blogarch/2002_01_01_archive.php#8415625). But rest assured, the obtuse party is not you, as you are reading my web site. And the person whom I was chastising does not.

Heh.
