**Idea:** Once broadband is more widespread, how about some javascript (or maybe a browser add-in) that adds **meta-data** to the tooltip on a link? Something like the date of the last update and maybe the registrant of the link’s domain when you hover over the text. I’ll have to look into it.

Has anyone seen **something like this**? It’s like [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com), only more integrated. Speaking of which, is it common knowledge that **[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) owns Alexa now**? Seems like a lot of potential for a conflict of interest there.
