[William Gedney](http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/gedney/) is an artist I had never heard of before today, but I found an incredible site documenting his career and his life, including what appears to be a comprehensive archive of his [photography](http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/gedney/photographs.html). Go take a look, of particular interest to me of course are his photos of [New York](http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/gedney/categories.html#newyork) and [India](http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/gedney/categories.html#india), both of which mirror my views of those places.
