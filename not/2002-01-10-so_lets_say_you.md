So, let’s say you’re at the top of your field. You might say you’re at the Apex. And, since you’re the best, you might want to instill in others in your organization the same desire to excel. You might want “excellence” to be in the front of their minds. So what would you name your organization?

Well, probably, [Apexcellent](http://www.apexcellent.com). Boy, is *that* a poopy website.
