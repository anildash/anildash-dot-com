Sign you are *not* the "bad boy" in the band: You **start crying when you get arrested**. According to [The Smoking Gun](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/doc_o_day/doc_o_day.shtml):

> “The cops arrested him, put him in handcuffs, and then put him in the police car. Nick [Carter] wasn’t belligerent, but he started bawling. He said, ‘You just want to arrest a Backstreet Boy. I’ve never been arrested. I don’t know what to do!’ He was crying hard. Tears were streaming down his face. People were laughing at him. The cops were chuckling.”

That’s why Nick’s only my fourth-favorite Backstreet Boy. Wuss.
