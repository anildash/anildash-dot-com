Did we know that some [Amazon lists](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-fil/-/A2G6R5OK28SI0O/104-9515010-7063119) are made by companies? For example, [David Payne](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-glance/-/A2G6R5OK28SI0O/104-9515010-7063119) is an eBusiness Channel Manager at [Viking](http://www.vikingcomponents.com/), and has made over a thousand "So you’d like to…" guides and almost as many Listmania lists on Amazon.

As a result, Viking products show up on almost any memory-related search, and it’s got to be helping their sales on the site significantly. There’s a vaguely astroturfing feeling to it, but it’s clearly not duplicitous or against Amazon’s policies. I’m curious to see if any other companies are doing this.
