For future reference, [Internet Explorer 6 and Standards](http://msdn.microsoft.com/voices/dude03262001.asp). Salient point: "The Internet Explorer team has put a great deal of effort into providing fast and stable implementations of 100 percent of CSS 1 and 100 percent of DOM level 1 with this release."

Also, they posted it a while ago, but there’s full documentation for [the Doctype switch](http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/css/overview/CSSEnhancements.asp) to select IE6’s compatible or compliant mode.
