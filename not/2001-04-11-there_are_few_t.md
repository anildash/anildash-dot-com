There are few things cooler (in my geeky, media-obsessed opinion) than getting an issue of a magazine you subscribe to, and seeing [someone you know](http://www.brillscontent.com/current/index.shtml) on the cover. Today, I got my issue, and it was downright exciting. The only downside is that Rock Star Matt is turning into a bit of a diva. First, it was the incessant, “Go check the newsstands, I need to know if the public can see me yet!” demands. Then, it progressed to, “I need cover scans! And photos of the magazine where you spot it!” And was that, perchance, a touch of *makeup* on someone’s cover-gracing face?

These things were understandable.

But I fear that the evil gremlin of Ego has finally struck young Matt Haughey. Please visit Matt’s site at [BiggerThanJesus.org](http://biggerthanjesus.org/).
