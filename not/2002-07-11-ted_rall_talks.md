I don’t usually like to write about current events, and I like even less to agree with Ted Rall, whom I usually perceive as forming his opinions prior to viewing the facts, but he’s absolutely, positively right when he describes [how to win the war on terrorism](http://www.uexpress.com/tedrall/site/viewru.cfm?uc_full_date=20020709&amp;uc_comic=ru&amp;uc_daction=X). The only point I’d disagree with is the propensity everyone has for labelling the LAX shootings as terrorism. If losing your shit and shooting 2 people is considered terrorism, then I’d love for all the white guys in this country to start getting profiled, as they’ve got a *long* history of freaking out and picking people off at the Post Office or McDonald’s.
