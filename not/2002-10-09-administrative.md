A little administrative note for those few of you who still insist on contacting me by phone: My phone number will be changing today whenever I find a cool new phone that’s suitable for joining my daily gadget armament. In other words, you won’t be able to reach me at my old number anymore, so email me for the new one.

A note for everyone who still insists on having a land line: phonez sux. And for those who asked, I got [this Ericsson phone](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=2020-20&amp;creative=9441&amp;camp=1793&amp;link_code=xml&amp;path=ASIN/B000068WQ2/2020-20/ref=nosim). Kinda purty color screen, but waaay too many features. The one I got is a Japanese import, with japanese on the number buttons and it had the firmware upgraded to the T68i software, so it has most of the features of the newer model. Funny that I still geeked out on this thing, even though I pretty much can’t stand phones.
